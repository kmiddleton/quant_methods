County Roads 320 (the Rifle-Rulison Road), 115 (Red Canyon Road) and 100 (Catherine Store Road) in Missouri Heights were closed in late July as a result of mudslides and rockfalls along certain stretches.  Public Works Director Betsy Suerth got permission on Monday from the Garfield Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) to spent an estimated $2 million to fix the roads, and to do so in an â€œexpedited mannerâ€ to get the roads open to the public as quickly as possible.  â€œI believe that the damages have caused unsafe conditions and pose a threat to the safety of the public,â€ Suerth told the BOCC.  County attorney Andrew Gorgey assured the BOCC that state law does allow for such shortcuts in the case of emergencies.  That means the county's normal procurement system, in particular the advertisement for requests for proposals from interested contractors, will be skipped.  In fact, one contract, for $459,548 to fix the Rifle-Rulison Road, was awarded on Monday to the Con-Sy Inc. company of Rifle.  Con-Sy was the low bidder in a list of three firms, which included Frontier Paving and Aspen Earth Moving.  Commissioner Mike Samson, agreeing with the other two commissioners that â€œwe definitely have to do something,â€ balked at spending $2 million so quickly.  â€œIs there another approach to this?â€ he asked.  Although the contract for one road already has been awarded, Garfield County procurement officer Jim Hackett said it will be another 10 days before the same could be done for the other two roads.  In the meantime, Commissioner John Martin suggested that the need to fix Red Canyon Road, in particular, should be examined.  â€œThat has been deemed an argument since the creation of 115 Road itself,â€ he remarked. â€œDoes it really need to be open, because it's such a dangerous road.â€  Garfield County officials have debated the subject for years, bickering about the narrow road enclosed by steep canyon walls that, on one side, form a sheer drop to the floor far below. In winter, the steep canyon walls allows in little sun to melt accumulated snow and ice, making the road even more treacherous.  County Manager Ed Green said the county could look at rebuilding Red Canyon Road to make it safer, a project he predicted could cost as much a $28 million.

The rains and winds from Dora, which was moving along Mexico's Pacific coast, were reported to cause flooding, landslides and falling trees in the Southern States of Chiapas and Gurrero and central states of Michoacan, Nayarit and Colima, an official at Mexico's National Metrological Center said.  There were no immediate reports of casualties, but emergency personal were on full alert as Dora is expected to continue to move along the coast for several more days, dumping rain on vulnerable mountain communities where soils easily saturate and lead to landslides.  Mexico's Navy Ministry said the danger index measured for the powerful storm was ""severe"" because of the affects of the elevated waves with undercurrents while the NHC said Dora continued to cause ""life-threatening"" conditions in the coastal areas.  The NHC said Dora may strengthen further and become a Category 5 hurricane later Thursday before it starts weakening sometime Friday when moving further out over the Pacific Ocean in north- western direction.

Dora continued to be ""an extremely dangerous"" Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds reaching as much as 250 kilometers per hour and with the highest gusts measured at 305 kilometers per hour, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.  The rains and winds from Dora, which was moving along Mexico's Pacific coast, were reported to cause flooding, landslides and falling trees in the Southern States of Chiapas and Gurrero and central states of Michoacan, Nayarit and Colima, an official at Mexico's National Metrological Center said.  There were no immediate reports of casualties, but emergency personal were on full alert as Dora is expected to continue to move along the coast for several more days, dumping rain on vulnerable mountain communities where soils easily saturate and lead to landslides.  Mexico's Navy Ministry said the danger index measured for the powerful storm was ""severe"" because of the affects of the elevated waves with undercurrents while the NHC said Dora continued to cause ""life-threatening"" conditions in the coastal areas.  The NHC said Dora may strengthen further and become a Category 5 hurricane later Thursday before it starts weakening sometime Friday when moving further out over the Pacific Ocean in north- western direction.  At 14:00 local time (19:00 GMT), Dura was located about 250 kilometers southwest of the port of Mazanillo, and about 390 kilometers south-southwest of the popular beach resort town of Puerto Vallarta.",,Unknown,Medium,,glc,3834,Mexico,Chilpancingo de los Bravos,6.8095,Guerrero,,165250,MX,NA,s5ufMJgKU,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,17.497399999999999,-99.537999999999997,"(17.497399999999999, -99.537999999999997)"

The Gomez Muldonado family had noticed the river behind their house in Mexico swelling, and tried to take precautions. They packed their car with essentials so they could get away quickly. They slept at the nearby coffee plantation at night rather than their house. But in the end, it didn't matter. At about 3 p.m. Sept. 16, days of rain from Tropical Storm Manuel caused a mudslide that buried half of the small, coffee-growing town of La Pintada. Although the tragedy occurred more than 2,000 miles away, its heartbreak and loss have overwhelmed families in Bluffton. Irma Gomez, who moved from La Pintada 13 years ago, lost 20 relatives in the mudslide. Among them were her mother, father and two brothers. ""It is very sad and devastating because they lost everything and we lost everything,"" Gomez, 31, said through a translator. ""We don't know if we ever are going to be able to go back there."" Gomez's family is not the only one struck by the disaster. The assistant principal at Red Cedar Elementary School, where one of Gomez's children is enrolled, said at least three local families were directly affected. But the number of people touched indirectly is much higher, she said. Gomez first learned of the disaster on Facebook since no communication was coming from the town. She didn't want to believe it was true at first, she said. But after talking to her brother, Jose Antonio, who was not in the house at the time and survived, reality started to set in. ""We try to find peace, but we can't,"" Gomez said of several of her brothers and sisters who also live in the Bluffton area. ""We still hold on to the hope that somebody is still alive, but every day that passes takes away that hope."" As soon as she learned of the mudslide, Gomez called every aid organization she could think of to tell them there were people who needed help and ask what was being done. She said she kept getting the same answer: ""We're working on it."" But later Gomez heard from her brother and other survivors that the help never came. She said she kept hearing: ""We're hungry; we're cold; we have injured people, and we don't have any help."" Three days had gone by and still there was no relief for La Pintada, a town of 800 in the southwest Guerrero state of Mexico. The dead number more than 100, and more than 60 people are declared missing. ""There was nothing, no help,"" Gomez said. ""Nada, nada."" Finally, on the fourth day, some help arrived. But not for long, she said. Only eight bodies were recovered before the authorities departed again, Gomez said. ""I cannot sleep at night because we feel powerless, because we cannot go there and can't do anything from here,"" Gomez said. ""We would like to go and dig with our own hands."" Red Cedar Elementary School is trying to help the families and the town. Starting this week the school's Kindness Club will collect coins and donations from students and the community, assistant principal Melissa Vogt said. ""Even though it is many thousands of miles away, people are directly and indirectly affected right here in our community,"" Vogt said. ""So the school is trying to provide that stable environment while supporting our families."" Vogt said collections will begin Tuesday or Wednesday and will last a week. The school then will send what it gathers to the Red Cross in Mexico, she said.

The Mexican government said the country had not seen a similar weather crisis since 1958, when the country was simultaneously hit by two tropical storms, also on separate coasts. The governor of the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz announced that 12 people died when a landslide smashed into a bus traveling through the town of Altotonga, about 40 miles northwest of the state capital. More than 23,000 people fled their homes in the state due to heavy rains spawned by Ingrid, and 9,000 went to emergency shelters. At least 20 highways and 12 bridges had been damaged, the state's civil protection authority said. Some of the heaviest damage was in the southern coastal state of Guerrero, where Mexico's government reported 15 confirmed deaths from Manuel. State officials said people had been killed in landslides, drownings in a swollen river and a truck crash on a rain-slickened mountain highway. Flooding closed the main highway from Mexico City to Acapulco, and power cuts shut the resort city's main airport, isolating many tourists over a long holiday weekend. Telephone service was cut around the state, though authorities said it was mostly restored by Monday afternoon. Mexico's federal Civil Protection coordinator, Luis Felipe Puente, told reporters late Sunday that stormy weather from one or both of the two systems also caused three deaths in Hidalgo, three in Puebla and one in Oaxaca. Manuel came ashore as a tropical storm Sunday afternoon near the Pacific port of Manzanillo, but quickly lost strength and was downgraded to a tropical depression late Sunday. It dissipated into an unorganized rain system Monday. Manuel dumped heavy rains over much of the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit, presenting a dangerous threat in mountains where flash floods and mudslides were possible. Late Monday, Ingrid had moved inland over northeastern Mexico and was a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 kph). It was centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of the Ciudad Vitoria, capital of Tamaulipas and was moving west at 5 mph (7 kph).

One of the sheriffs said, â€˜weâ€™re kind of playing in a game that we donâ€™t know the rules and we might not even even be sure which game weâ€™re playing.â€™â€  Gary Garland and his staff have dug channels in the hopes of draining any potential mudslide away from the property. Fifty homes and businesses sit in the potential pathway of mudslides. Kazian said engineers helped almost all of them by installing concrete blockades called â€œjersey barriersâ€ to divert the mudslides.",unknown,Known_within_5_km,Small,,glc,6128,United States,Sedona,5.43356,Arizona,Coconino County,10031,US,NA,h5bfheC7eVwPD,1,Sun Aug 24 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,34.909799999999997,-111.7268,"(34.909799999999997, -111.7268)"

Local firefighters have made contact with three of the men, and are supplying them with oxygen via a hosepipe while rocks and debris are cleared from the mine entrance by hand to avoid causing any further ground movements. The fate of the remaining miners is unclear, and it is understood that the mine reaches 80 m beneath the surface. It is unclear whether the landslide was triggered by the activities of the miners, or whether it was caused by rainfall. Landslides are a common problem after severe weather events, as excess pore water pressure overcomes the sediments cohesion and allows it to flow downhill. Approximately 90% of all landslides are caused by heavy rainfall.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.",,Known_within_25_km,Medium,,glc,5516,United States,Mountain Home,32.715699999999998,Idaho,Elmore County,14206,US,NA,D93F5GFKU,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,43.420499999999997,-115.60429999999999,"(43.420499999999997, -115.60429999999999)"

This week, the city continued to approve extra expenses as crews finish building the new and bigger sewer system near Burr Ridge on Purgatory Creek that was overwhelmed during the May and June rains. â€œIt was one of, if not the biggest, rainfall, and unfortunately we were working on a big project,â€ said Robert Ellis, the cityâ€™s public works director. In May, heavy rainfall overflowed the neighborhoodâ€™s 37-year-old sewer system, eroding land between two homes on the ridge.

The city made an emergency decision to demolish his house and is now in the process of buying his property to stabilize the slope and build the bigger sewer system, which will have a channel handling four to 10 times more stormwater than the old system, Ellis said. â€œIt provides a level of protection that neighborhood has never had,â€ he added.

The slide occurred around 9:30 p.m. in the northeast section of the mine, Kennecott spokesman Kyle Bennett said. No employees were injured in the slide and its size was not immediately unknown, though it is estimated to be about 2,000-feet wide and 2,000-feet long. ""As of 1 p.m. (Thursday), we are continuing to assess the situation,"" Bennett said. ""We have not been able to determine the magnitude of the slide at this time, but we do know that it is significant."" The copper-mining company was aware of the impending slide and had warned residents near the mine Wednesday that a slide was possible any day. Kennecott engineers had been detecting ground movement as far back as February. At the time, the movement amounted to just fractions of an inch, but it was enough for the company to close and relocate the mine's visitors center. Engineers at the Bingham Canyon mine spent their time Thursday using sophisticated technology to monitor the area of a giant landside that broke free Wednesday night. But with the help of KSL's Chopper 5, they now have more specific information that will help them determine their next move. Ted Himebaugh has worked at the Bingham Canyon mine for the past 36 years; he's been the mine's general manager of operational readiness for the past decade. He's also part of a team that has focused on an impending landslide problem since the earth started to move in February. ""It's the largest slide we've ever had at the Bingham Canyon mine; and I don't know if it's the largest slide in Utah, but it's a big slide,"" Himebaugh said. Analyzing KSL's Chopper 5 video Thursday helped him to better understand what happened. ""Where it ended at the bottom, it went a little bit further into the bottom than we planned on,"" Himebaugh said, pointing to the video screen. ""We were not expecting that it would cover that much area in the bottom."" In fact, two-thirds of the bottom of the pit is now covered. The video also helped Himebaugh spot some of the mine's equipment, including nine partially buried trucks, each of them the size of a small home. But his crew's main objective now is to determine the impact of the damage in the bottom of the pit. ""We didn't know from our modeling that all that material would flow to the bottom,"" Himebaugh said. For now, he says the movement of that slide has stopped, but it's too early for his team to determine how soon they can get into that area to assess the damage. ""This is something that we had anticipated,"" Bennett said of the slide. ""We knew the slide was imminent. We had relocated machinery, we had rerouted roads, we had rerouted utilities, we had rerouted buildings."" Over the past few days, engineers started seeing movement of up to 2 inches per day. ""We've seen acceleration rates increase until where we landed (Wednesday night),"" Bennett said. ""When it reaches 2 inches per day, that's certainly a time when we want to take steps that we have been planning for a number of weeks in order to make sure people are out of the way."" All employees were evacuated in preemptive measures and were safe and accounted for after the slide. Bennett said access to the mine continued to be restricted Thursday and that no employees were being allowed to enter. ""Our job is to safely produce copper. That's our goal,"" Bennett said. ""That's what we want to do. Our employees are critical to that."" The company has not been able to measure the magnitude of the slide and doesn't know if there will be any residual sliding in the days to come. Bennett said experts will continue monitoring the area remotely for other possible slides. ""They're collecting data from our systems, doing visual inspections,"" he said. ""Our monitoring systems identified this as one slide that failed progressively."" Bennett said there did not appear to have been any impacts to the community as a result of the slide. ""The movement has been contained to the mine and presents no threat to the public,"" he said. ""Minimal dust resulted from the slide, in part because of the favorable weather conditions.""",,Known_within_1_km,Medium,,glc,5544,United States,Herriman,9.5519,Utah,Salt Lake County,21785,US,NA,DGs-aLDwgs,2,Fri Sep 12 2014 15:48:37 GMT+0000 (UTC),3036149436,40.5366,-112.1418,"(40.5366, -112.1418)"

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Sunday that the Ohio Emergency Management Agency estimates the county has $7.4 million in damage. Statewide, the estimate is at $43 million.  The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.  In the Cincinnati region, including northern Kentucky, 41.04 inches of rain have fallen since the start of the year, twice the amount that had fallen over the same time period in 2010 and slightly more than the average 12-month rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.  â€œItâ€™s possible weâ€™ll exceed the all-time wettest year on record,â€ said Don Hughes, a meteorologist technician with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.  Part of an infrastructure tax, prompted by a 1986-87 business study, nets about $700,000 a year in Cincinnati and has helped fund a program that works to stabilize against landslides, The Enquirer reports.  Since the program started, the city has stabilized more than 60 locations, said Rich Pohana, Cincinnatiâ€™s geotechnical engineer.  â€œIf those slides were not stabilized this would have been much more dramatic,â€ he said.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.",,Known_within_1_km,Medium,,glc,5513,United States,Mountain Home,30.719069999999999,Idaho,Elmore County,14206,US,NA,hJQB59mQ4,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,43.387700000000002,-115.5441,"(43.387700000000002, -115.5441)"

No one was injured in the mudslide early Saturday, but a cement truck was left stuck on the road. Federal officials are looking at ways to fix the road, which buckled and sank more than 30 meters (nearly 100 feet) in the mudslide. Several million dollars will have to be spent to reopen the highway as soon as possible, Communications and Transportation Secretariat deputy director of public works Efrain Arias said. Arias, however, did not provide a timetable for the road's repairs and reopening. Officials have been ""working on alternate routes and they are functioning perfectly well,"" Arias said. The repair project could take up to a year to complete, Ensenada Mayor Gilberto Hirata said. Federal officials are responsible for what happened because they ignored previous buckling of the road and a recommendation from geologists at the Advanced Scientific Research and Education Center in Ensenada to close the highway, Hirata said. Officials overseeing the repair project will consult the center's personnel, who are familiar with soil conditions in the area, where a number of geological faults are present, the mayor said.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Sunday that the Ohio Emergency Management Agency estimates the county has $7.4 million in damage. Statewide, the estimate is at $43 million.  The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.  In the Cincinnati region, including northern Kentucky, 41.04 inches of rain have fallen since the start of the year, twice the amount that had fallen over the same time period in 2010 and slightly more than the average 12-month rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.  â€œItâ€™s possible weâ€™ll exceed the all-time wettest year on record,â€ said Don Hughes, a meteorologist technician with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.  Part of an infrastructure tax, prompted by a 1986-87 business study, nets about $700,000 a year in Cincinnati and has helped fund a program that works to stabilize against landslides, The Enquirer reports.  Since the program started, the city has stabilized more than 60 locations, said Rich Pohana, Cincinnatiâ€™s geotechnical engineer.  â€œIf those slides were not stabilized this would have been much more dramatic,â€ he said.

The situation had not been resolved up to late yesterday evening, Rondon said, adding that the mudslide was over a month in the making and was now beyond the capabilities of the corporation. Up to late yesterday, dozens were unable to get to their homes in Matelot as the road remained impassable, he said.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.",,Known_within_1_km,Medium,,glc,5515,United States,Mountain Home,27.87603,Idaho,Elmore County,14206,US,NA,DJ6YG9FQU,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,43.335900000000002,-115.4894,"(43.335900000000002, -115.4894)"

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months.

The most outstanding feature of this so-called Bolivarian revolution has been the lack of investment in development plans in any of the areas that are vital to the country. As a consequence, PDVSA, the national electricity system, the public transportation system, the potable water system, the sewage system, and garbage collection (or lack of it) are all showing serious signs of deterioration, this being the hallmark of ChÃ¡vezâ€™s style of government. Much less has there been any urban planning that takes into account the public services that will be required as a result of natural population growth.  Another area that reflects the failure of the â€œrevolutionâ€™sâ€ government is the countryâ€™s infrastructure, particularly the roads. Here the Bolivarians have not hit on ways to maintain existing infrastructure or to invest in the building of new roads. It is no longer just that it let the Caracas-La Guaira Viaduct collapse or that it failed to find a lasting solution to the problem of La Cabrera Tunnel or that it turned a deaf ear to warnings by experts of the risks posed by the bridges over the Orinoco River and Lake Maracaibo. Now people all around the country are suffering the consequences of the governmentâ€™s ineptitude, finding themselves penned in because urban and interurban roads are full of potholes, blocked by landslides or have partly disappeared after huge chunks have fallen into the abyss. Some weeks ago, the national press reported that MÃ©rida was completely cut off owing to landslides on the road that connects it to Barinitas and Barinas. Another landslide kept the stretch of the Charallave National Highway that links it up with the Central Regional Highway closed between July 3 and July 9, complicating things for traffic going to Maracay and Valencia.  Last week, part of the Valle-Coche Freeway, in the area of Fuerte Tiuna, collapsed owing to a mega hole -more than 2 meters deep and two lanes wide- caused by a burst water pipe (for which Hidrocapital is responsible).  Now people are warning of the risk the Pan-American Highway (Los Teques-Caracas) is running of collapsing owing to a huge hole at Km 25, which started to appear a year ago and has already eaten away two lanes.

Manuel was expected to dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over parts of Guerrero and Michoacan state, with maximums of 25 inches possible in some isolated areas.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.",,Known_within_1_km,Medium,,glc,5511,United States,Mountain Home,28.846489999999999,Idaho,Elmore County,14206,US,NA,h5ZY99gQ4,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,43.34,-115.4769,"(43.34, -115.4769)"

Hundreds of landslides occurred during the storm that dropped record rains on the Boulder area, Jonathan Godt, a U.S. Geological Survey researcher with the Landslide Hazards Program, reported here Tuesday (Oct. 29) at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. The damage occurred inside a triangle along Colorado's Front Range Mountains, spanning an area some 1,150 square miles (3,000 square kilometers). Rockslides are a danger even now, more than a month later, Godt said, and will remain so for some time to come. [Photos of Colorado's Landslides] Several days of heavy, tropical-style rain fell in northern Colorado beginning Sept. 9 and intensifying Sept. 11 and 12, when floodwaters began to rise in Boulder (which saw more than 7 inches, or 18 centimeters, of rain in one day) and other foothill towns. Lyons, Colo., was cut off from the outside worldby raging waters; roads snaking through canyons were washed away entirely. East of Denver, the city of Aurora also saw extreme rain and flooding. Three people died in landslides and debris flows during the flooding, including a man in Jamestown, Colo., whose home was hit. There were also many thousands of dollars of uninsured damage to property, Godt said. One building on Arapahoe Avenue in Boulder was cut in half by a landslide. ""That building was formerly one building,"" Godt said. ""Now it's two."" Landslides spanned the gamut of northern Colorado geology and environments, Godt said. There were slides in Boulder and Golden, both towns in the foothills at elevations around 5,500 feet (1,676 meters). Far above, slides scar Rocky Mountain National Park near the continental divide at about 12,000 feet (3,658 m). The widespread nature of the rain and flooding meant that nothing was safe from slope failures: Sedimentary rocks slid, as did crystalline rocks immediately west of the foothills. Hillsides turned into landslides in residential areas among grasslands and in alpine environments along the treeline. Many of these landslides started off small and gained momentum as they rolled down slopes, Godt said. Some left behind rivers of debris about 6 .5 feet (2 m) thick. Some slides moved boulders 6.5 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) long as if they were pebbles. Among the most impressive slides was one on the east flank of Twin Sisters Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park.

The flows have since returned to normal. ""What's interesting about this storm is it was very localized.

They thought they'd be safe there. But a wall of water was heading their way, and the ground behind the house where they were staying was becoming so saturated it was ready to slide. The small town of Salina -- at the junction of Fourmile Canyon and Gold Run Road -- was hit hard by the devastating 100-year flood. ""We were only asleep for about a half-hour when the mudslide happened,"" Grainger said. A sheet of water, mud and sediment filled the house, slamming Grainger into the wall. She was trapped against the door, with water quickly rising up to her chest. ""It was chaos,"" she said. ""Everyone was screaming."" Wading around in the 55-degree water, barefoot, in the pitch black with the roar of the fast-moving water, LeGoff tried to locate his wife. ""When something you love is going to be taken away from you, you find a way to save it. You don't stop,"" he said. ""I thought in 30 seconds I would lose everything I had -- my wife, my two dogs, the two cats. I was on my way to losing everything."" Once LeGoff reached his wife, he realized she was trapped. ""I remember looking at Michelle when she said, 'Steve, I don't want to die this way.' I looked back and said, 'You are not going to die this way.'"" He tried to smash windows, but when that didn't work he kicked out the door behind his wife. ""That's when the water had a place to escape, and the water went down,"" LeGoff said.

""All I could think to do is to breathe into her mouth, so I start blowing and screaming at her,"" Grainger said. LeGoff said he and a friend garnered the strength to lift three microwave-sized boulders off of Grainger. She was finally freed. Elsewhere in the house, their neighbor was trapped in a bedroom. Grainger went to get help from others to dig him out of the mud. The families escaped to another house in town on higher ground and spent the rest of the night there. All of their pets were accounted for, including their cat, which had suffered a broken leg. In two separate rescue missions, the two families and their pets were all airlifted out by a Black Hawk helicopter. Grainger had suffered a compression fracture in her back and two broken ribs. ""It's unbelievable that we all got out,"" LeGroff said. Grainger and LeGoff have no plans to move out of the Fourmile Canyon area. ""We were hit really bad by this flood, but we are going to find a way. There has to be a way,"" Grainger said. ""Salina is our family; we have lived here for 22 years. We can't imagine living anywhere else."" 'We can't rebuild on that land' While evacuating their Salina home, Sean and Meg McCroskey made an unspoken pact to maintain a facade of normalcy during the flooding and everything that followed to protect their two sons, Greyson, 4, and Carter, 3. When they learned that their 2,200-square-foot home had been reduced to rubble at the breakfast table of a friend they were staying with, they just looked at each other, trying not to let the shock and sadness show on their faces. They each hiked down alone to the pile of rubble that was their home for a private moment of grieving, but since then, like many Boulder County families affected by the flood, they've been in survival and recovery mode. ""Sometimes I feel like I go through the grieving process quickly,"" said Meg McCroskey, 36. ""I bawled and I sobbed, but you have two little guys, you gotta keep it together. You have to be optimistic. You have to move on."" The McCroskeys' house is a total loss. One car is stranded near their home with no way to drive it down out of the mountains. They have no flood insurance. They expect to get help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but the maximum amount of aid they were told they could receive from FEMA is roughly $32,000, Meg McCroskey said. With help and donations from friends and strangers through an online fundraising site, though, the McCroskeys say they'll find a way to get back to normal. Sean McCroskey, who works for data storage provider NetApp, began communicating with his boss Clint Owens shortly after they evacuated. Owens, who lives in Portland, Ore., set up a fundraising page through the websiteGoFundMe.com, and within a week, friends, neighbors and complete strangers from around the world had amassed tens of thousands of dollars for the McCroskeys. As of Friday night, they had raised more than $81,000. Owens said it's been ""amazing to watch the giving nature of people."" The money and well wishes will make life a little easier in the coming months and years as they attempt to find ""normal"" again, Sean McCroskey said. ""I'm not unlike anybody else in this world,"" he said. ""I work hard and I've worked hard for a long time to have what I had, and just to have that be taken away from you in an instant, it's hard. It's just hard."" Certain areas near their home have washed out every time it's rained since the Fourmile Fire of 2010, and the evening of Sept. 11, the McCroskey family thought the area near their home might flood. They moved their truck and boat out of that washout zone and went to bed, not thinking much of the heavy rain that kept falling in Boulder County. When they woke up the next morning, their driveway culvert had washed out, and Gold Run Creek -- normally no wider than a sidewalk -- was rushing furiously over top of their driveway. One of their cars was hanging precariously off a newly formed cliff by its two front tires. The rushing waters kept eroding away the McCroskeys' land. At about 5 p.m. Sept. 12, the creek caught hold of the other side of the house and started eating away at the land under their home. Sean and Meg McCroskey packed up some food and clothing in their two heavy-duty backpacking packs and grabbed the cat, Franklin, and dog, Gretta. The young family began hiking uphill to their friend Pete Brady's house, with Greyson and Carter splashing in puddles along the way. While they hiked, Franklin, a jet-black, 1-year-old kitten, clawed his way out of Meg McCroskey's arms. ""I couldn't hold him anymore. Greyson was like, 'Mommy, we're going to have to let him go. We're going to have to leave him.'"" They spent the night with Brady and in the morning called a neighbor across the street, who informed the McCroskeys that their two-story, grey-blue home had collapsed. Later, when Sean McCroskey hiked down to their home, he called for the skinny black cat and found him, miraculously unharmed, in a patch of sun near the house. ""I walked up to him, and his motor starts purring,"" Sean McCroskey, 42, said. ""I sit down and hang out with him for a second. He sits on my lap. I'm talking to him about the night he had and the night we had."" He carried Franklin, kicking and yowling, back to Brady's house. On the afternoon of Sept. 13, they hiked to the top of Melvina Hill Road and waited almost three hours for the weather to clear so that a National Guard helicopter could land. Sean McCroskey hiked the five miles down to Boulder with their dog while Meg McCroskey, the two boys and the cat were airlifted out of the mountains. Friends in Superior took the McCroskeys in that night. When Sean McCrosky woke up Sept. 14, the full weight of his family's situation fell on him. Everyone -- including the cat and dog -- was safe. He sobbed alone in his temporary room. ""It was the release of dealing with the whole fiasco,"" he said. ""To be somewhere where you don't have to worry about, 'Are we safe? Is there power, water? Is my son going to have something to eat?'"" The McCroskeys will soon move into a long-term hotel paid for by Sean McCroskey's company. They have no longer-term housing plans: They don't want to leave their mountain community, but they're not sure they can afford to rebuild in Salina. The McCroskeys moved to that blue house with white trim in June 2010, and on Labor Day that year, they were evacuated during the Fourmile Fire. Six weeks later, they moved back home, settled in with their new charred landscape and became part of the close-knit community that is Salina. ""There's not much we can do,"" Meg McCroskey said. ""We can't rebuild on that land. We'd have to build it all back up and start over, and I'm not sure we'd be able to afford that.""",,Known_within_5_km,Medium,,glc,5517,United States,Boulder,9.54612,Colorado,Boulder County,97385,US,NA,S9bhN9gB7,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,40.0505,-105.3724,"(40.0505, -105.3724)"

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.",,Known_within_1_km,Medium,,glc,5514,United States,Mountain Home,31.78115,Idaho,Elmore County,14206,US,NA,h5Zc55dQW,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,43.4026,-115.5605,"(43.4026, -115.5605)"

A mudslide last Thursday temporarily blocked Highway 20 at milepost 114.5, about 18 miles east of Mountain Home, between the Cow Creek/Prairie Road and the Anderson Dam Road. It took about two hours for the slide to be cleared. But that wasn't the only incident, just one of the more visible ones. The short but intense rain event Thursday created numerous flash floods in the area of the Elk Fire Complex along the South Fork Boise River area from Granite Creek, extending east of the Anderson Ranch Dam to Fall Creek. Ten major drainages had significant mud and debris flows that went over the road system and into the South Fork Boise River and Anderson Ranch Reservoir. In addition, at least a half dozen creeks that do not have names had mud flows going across the roads, Forest Service officials said. An Anderson Ranch Dam rain gauge showed nearly half an inch of rain occurred between 6:30-7:15 p.m. Thursday night. Hydrologists with the Burned Area Emergency Response team that had evaluated the burned areas had estimated a half-inch rain event on the severely burned soils would create flash floods. Elmore County closed several roads accessing the area and the Mountain Home Highway District personnel are working to open the roads. Creeks affected included Pearce, Granite, Rough, Dixie, Mill, Elk, Wilson, Evans, Castle and the Reclamation Village area. The storm was localized and the Prairie and Pine- Featherville areas did not report any damage. Due to the storm event, the South Fork Boise River remains closed, which will prohibit rafting from the Cow Creek Bridge downstream to the confluence with Arrowrock Reservoir. The closure is due to the current heavy volume of sediment, logs and other debris in the river. ""We are very concerned of a boater starting a trip downriver in this isolated and limited communication section of the river,"" said Cecilia Seesholtz, Boise National Forest Supervisor. ""This local area has been hit hard and a lot of work will need to be done to clear the roads and lessen the risks in the river over the upcoming days.""

According to the Coconino County SheriffÃ•s Office, the 27-year-old victim was trapped in a rock slide as he attempted to move one large boulder from the middle of Elden Lookout Road shortly before 7:30 a.m. A second boulder weighing more than 30 tons slid down the mountainside, crushing his legs and pelvic area. Four men who were traveling with the victim managed to free him before rescue crews arrived. The men told investigators the group had come up from the Phoenix area to work on one of the radio towers on Mount Elden.ÃŠ A SheriffÃ•s Office patrol sergeant and corporal were the first to arrive on the scene. They found the victim and his travel companions more than three miles up from the bottom of the mountain. According to the SheriffÃ•s Office, the manÃ•s legs and pelvis had been severely injured by the weight of the boulder.ÃŠ First responders from the Summit Fire Department and Guardian Medical Transport also attempted to reach the victim. However, road conditions prevented the ambulance and fire truck from going up the mountain. The batallion chief for Guardian Medical Transport and a SheriffÃ•s sergeant had to use four-wheel-drive vehicles to bring additional rescue personnel to the injured man.ÃŠ An SUV also had to carry the victim down the mountain to a waiting ambulance because there was no safe place for a Search and Rescue helicopter to land. The injured man was transferred to an ambulance at the bottom of Mount Elden and transported to Flagstaff Medical Center for treatment. The rock slide has prompted the Flagstaff Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest to close Elden Lookout Road to vehicles starting at the junction with Rocky Ridge Trail. According to Forest Service officials, rain has also caused falling boulders, rockslides, washouts and debris in other areas. That has led to additional closures, including an area closure between Upper Oldham Trail to Sunset Trail.

Officials said there were some two dozen aftershocks overnight, as they placed the nation on orange alert, one below the highest level red. The temblor caused cuts in power, interruptions in phone service and landslides, and was felt as far away as neighboring El Salvador and in southern Mexico. But there were no casualties reported from the quake, which according to U.S. seismologists struck 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from Pajapita, Guatemala at a depth of 67.7 kilometers at 0013 GMT Saturday. Southeastern Mexico was also jolted by at least three aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 6.1 felt near Ciudad Hidalgo, in the state of Chiapas, close to the Guatemalan border. After the initial quake, residents had already evacuated their homes in several towns in the southern Mexican state while power was lost temporarily in Ciudad Hidalgo. The Environmental Observatory in San Salvador said the quake was centered on the coast of Guatemala and Mexico, measuring its strength slightly lower at 6.3 on the Richter scale. And the US Geological Survey said that the quake was just 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Suchiate, a municipality in the Mexican state of Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala. A second tremblor, measuring 5.4 in magnitude, occurred seven minutes later, according to the USGS, with its epicenter in the Pacific waters of Guatemala.

The resulting mudslide forced the largest evacuation of homes here in recent memory. The slide was the fourth in 2013, the result of a massive wildfire that denuded the mountain last year. To clear the diversion path, the city has brought in three massive hauling trucks and a backhoe. One road in Box Elder was closed to allow crews space to work. More than 1,100 volunteers turned up on Sunday to fill sandbags, which now line Moyle Drive and form a continuous wall along Alpine Boulevard.

Spooks Branch Road and an area near the intersection of Skyview Place and Sunset Drive, all in North Asheville, experienced landslides earlier this month due to heavy rains. Both instances resulted in lane or road closures. Assessment of the projectsÃ• scope began as soon as weather and the soil stability on site permitted. Because of the magnitude of their damage, the Skyview and Spooks Branch locations required working with outside contractors. Ã’We initiated an aggressive schedule,Ã“ said Streets and Engineering Services Manager Greg Shuler. During the bank restoration and repair, some road and lane closures are expected. During that time, barricades and markers will be used to indicate road or lane closures. In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks. Skyview Place and Sunset Drive are also currently closed to through traffic. Surrounding residences may also experience occasional water interruptions during construction.

It had been more than a year since the enormous Waldo Canyon Fire roared across the slopes above. But its burn scar is just beginning to recover, with little plant material Ã‘ living or dead Ã‘ to absorb this yearÃ•s late-summer rains. So when the storm came on Aug. 9, the runoff raced down, destroying or damaging 36 homes, engulfing half a dozen cars and killing John Collins, who was driving home from work. Manitou Springs was smeared with reddish mud and debris. Wildfire burn scars have spawned flash floods up and down ColoradoÃ•s Front Range and in other Western states this summer, saddling communities with millions of dollars in cleanup costs and leaving residents fearful and anxious. Ã’IÃ•m moving out,Ã“ Manitou Springs resident Donna Stone said after the August flood narrowly missed her house. Ã’ItÃ•s incomprehensible to me that I would be safe here.Ã“ The threat lingers years after the flames have been extinguished and the human and property losses of fire have been tallied. In New Mexico, where fires have scorched more than 285 square miles of mountain slopes this year, flash floods killed fish and washed out roads in Pecos Canyon, a popular fishing area. Homes near Flagstaff, Ariz., were flooded after rainfall on an area burned in 2010. Two other floods hit in July below ArizonaÃ•s Yarnell Hill, where 19 firefighters were killed on June 30. In Colorado, multiple flash floods have struck this summer in or near scars left by last yearÃ•s Waldo Canyon and High Park fires. The High Park Fire burned more than 136 square miles in Larimer County west of Fort Collins, killing one person and destroying nearly 260 homes. Waldo Canyon erupted days later near Colorado Springs, burning more than 28 square miles, killing two people and destroying nearly 350 homes. State officials expect to spend at least $10 million to repair flood-damaged roads and bridges in the two areas and to keep them open. Water utilities in Colorado Springs, Greeley and Fort Collins expect to spend more than $20 million Ã‘ including federal grants Ã‘ to repair and protect their systems in the burn areas. Manitou Springs has spent more than $130,000 on cleanup, City Administrator Jack Benson said. The city is looking into buying up to four houses in the flood area and using the land for a retention pond or some other flood control project, if funding can be found, he said. No single agency compiles the cost of erosion and floods caused by wildfires, but the U.S. Forest Service spent nearly $46 million nationwide in fiscal 2012 on emergency erosion measures. The money paid for mulch to absorb rain, shoring up roads and trails, and reseeding. Getting longer-term restoration money isnÃ•t easy. In June, the gridlocked Congress finally approved $19 million for erosion control for ColoradoÃ•s 2012 wildfires after months of lobbying by ColoradoÃ•s Democratic senators. Rain normally is soaked up by a sponge-like layer of pine needles and twigs on the forest ground, called duff. Wildfires can incinerate that layer, and burning duff can leave a waxy residue in the top layer of soil that sheds water. A relatively light rain can rush down charred hillsides into streambeds, picking up dirt, ash, rock and tree limbs along the way. Ã’ItÃ•s like concrete soup coming down,Ã“ said Eric Billmeyer, an instructor of geology and environmental studies at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs. It could be a decade before all the damage plays out, said Dale Miller, road and bridge director for Larimer County. Ã’We expect that as a result of the fire, any storm that we receive today is going to cause potentially 10 times the damage it would have before the fire,Ã“ Miller said. Denver Water, the stateÃ•s largest municipal utility, is still spending millions of dollars to stem erosion 12 years after the Hayman Fire, then ColoradoÃ•s largest ever, burned across 215 square miles in the foothills south of Denver. Ã’ItÃ•s going to take a very long time for these areas to stabilize,Ã“ Billmeyer said. Ã’Even with all the work thatÃ•s being done out there, really, you have to have the vegetation be restored.Ã“",,Known_within_15_km,Medium,,glc,5299,United States,Manitou Springs,1.60621,Colorado,El Paso County,4992,US,NA,S9qPM9FKW,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,38.853999999999999,-104.9342,"(38.853999999999999, -104.9342)"

Recent heavy rains are to blame as nearly two inches of rain a day, all at once, has caused berms atop the bluff to give in. ItÃ•s happened before but never this bad. Friday, crews worked on what amounts to a short term solution for the mudslide problem. ""Well short term we can get up there and we can break that waterfall. As we are doing now, we are coming down and making small terraces.

Homeowners who live atop the bluff say a long lasting solution needs to be found to avoid the collapse of any neighborhood roads. ""Look at how beautiful everything up here is. This is a wonderful park and you don't want it to wash away you know, so something definitely needs to be done,"" said Valenti. Fidler said the long term solution is something engineers have done before in other spots along the bluff that have been washed away in the past. ""Long term we want to control that storm water runoff. Instead of just shooting out we want to come out and bring it down and let it settle out in a bigger retention pond,"" said Fidler.

President Obama approved disaster status for Wilkes, Ashe, Avery, Catawba, Lincoln and Watauga counties on Tuesday, according to a White House press release issued about 10 p.m. Tuesday. The designation makes federal funding available to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit entities on a cost-share basis for emergency work, repairing or replacing facilities damaged by flooding and landslides and for hazard mitigation work, the press release said. The press release said more designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by results of more damage assessments. W. Craig Fugate, director of the N.C. Department of Public SafetyÃ•s Division of Emergency Management, named Michael Bolch as the coordinating officer for recovery operations in the six counties. Fugate also is Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator for North Carolina. Fugate said Wilkes CountyÃ•s estimated cost of damage eligible for federal aid is $687,334, which he said exceeds the threshold for making Wilkes eligible for being declared a disaster area by the federal government. Under the designation approved by the president, Wilkes and the other five counties are eligible for federal aid to help pay for emergency protective measures; water control facilities; removing debris and repairing roads, bridges, buildings, public utilities, parks and other recreational facilities. Fugate said that in Wilkes, the only damage reported and eligible for this federal aid so far is damage to N.C. Department of Transportation roads and bridges. He said no local governments in Wilkes reported public infrastructure damage. Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln werenÃ•t among counties declared a major disaster area in September by President Barack Obama, based on FEMAÃ•s recommendation, even though they were among 16 counties identified in Gov. Pat McCroryÃ•s request for the designation. On Oct. 23, U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan sent a letter to Fugate supporting North CarolinaÃ•s appeal for federal aid for recovery efforts from the damage in Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln counties in late July. A spokesman for Mrs. Hagan said Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln werenÃ•t included because an initial assessment of damage costs in the three counties combined didnÃ•t meet the federal governmentÃ•s threshold ofÃŠ $13,662,150 for being declared a major disaster area. The state appealed FEMAÃ•s denial after assessments completed in October identified more damage, raising the estimated cost in the three counties to $14,032,777. Ã’These damages clearly exceed the stateÃ•s threshold and warrant a finding by FEMA that public assistance funds are necessary in response to these incredibly damaging storms and floods,Ã“ Mrs. Hagan said in the letter to Fugate.Ã“ Mrs. HaganÃ•s letter said federal aid approved for the other 13 western N.C. counties was for damage from July 3-13. It said the assistance sought for Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln was for damage from July 14-27. As much as 12 inches of rain fell in the mountains of far northwestern Wilkes on July 26 and 27, causing flooding and landslides and damaging Fall Creek, Pumpkin Run, Big Ivy and other roads in the Parsonsville and Purlear areas. Charles Reinhardt, DOT division maintenance engineer, said the worst public road damage in northwestern Wilkes on July 26 and 27 resulted from a large landslide on Fall Creek Road. Only one lane of this paved road is open as repairs, estimated to cost about $750,000, continue. Reinhardt said Tuesday work is about 45 percent complete. Private roads in the Buck Mountain and Range Branch developments were heavily damaged July 26 and 27. The southbound lane of U.S. 21 on the Blue Ridge Mountain escarpment in Wilkes has been closed to traffic since June 11 due to a worsening depression and weakening retainer wall less than a mile from the Alleghany line. Heavy rain this summer worsened the U.S. 21 site, but Reinhardt said repairs are now about three weeks away from completion. He said DOT officials are optimistic about getting Federal Highway Administration funds to help pay for repairs on U.S. 21, estimated to cost about $1.2 million. Severe thunderstorms and heavy rains dumped 10 to over 20 inches of rain over much of the foothills and mountains in July. It was the wettest July on record in many counties, including Wilkes. There was also flood damage in the Roaring River community and elsewhere in Wilkes in July. Farmers suffered the most widespread flood damage in Wilkes this summer, mostly in bottomland cornfields. Included in the designation approved by Obama in September were Alleghany, Ashe, Caldwell, Watauga, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Jackson, Macon, Madison, Mitchell, Polk and Yancey counties and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians. In September, McCrory said early estimates indicated about $25 million in damage to roads, bridges, culverts, public utilities, parks and schools in western North Carolina this summer. The federal disaster declaration made federal funds available to cover 75 percent of the cost of repairs and debris removal in designated counties.",,Unknown,Medium,,glc,5216,United States,Millers Creek,17.741350000000001,North Carolina,Wilkes County,2112,US,NA,s9tsHsdKU,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,36.220399999999998,-81.431100000000001,"(36.220399999999998, -81.431100000000001)"

Spooks Branch Road and an area near the intersection of Skyview Place and Sunset Drive, all in North Asheville, experienced landslides earlier this month due to heavy rains. Both instances resulted in lane or road closures. Assessment of the projectsÃ• scope began as soon as weather and the soil stability on site permitted. Because of the magnitude of their damage, the Skyview and Spooks Branch locations required working with outside contractors. Ã’We initiated an aggressive schedule,Ã“ said Streets and Engineering Services Manager Greg Shuler. During the bank restoration and repair, some road and lane closures are expected. During that time, barricades and markers will be used to indicate road or lane closures. In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks. Skyview Place and Sunset Drive are also currently closed to through traffic. Surrounding residences may also experience occasional water interruptions during construction. See water service interruption information at http://www.ci.asheville.nc.us/Departments/Water/WaterOutages.aspx.

Engineers are working to determine the extent and cause of the damage.  A mudslide near Kirby Mountain Road between Lenoir and Blowing Rock damaged the road and the guardrail Sunday.  DOT workers poured green die into a storm drain to find out if water from the other side is seeping under the highway.  â€œThe only thing we could tell right now is the water came from the other side of the road and apparently itâ€™s going underneath ground,â€ Gioscio said. â€œOur goal is not to stop traffic, and weâ€™ve got a brand new road here. Thatâ€™s why we opened it up â€“ to keep people moving,â€  DOT workers say the contractor who widened the roadway is not responsible for the slide. They believe it formed under the old roadway and it will be up to the state to pay for the repairs.  -----  The slide was caused when heavy rains softened the soil and an underground stream of water began to flow out of the hillside.  Last week, Department of Transportation crews put special dyes in water near the site, hoping to be able to track where the problem in the hillside came from. ""We need to find out, it's important,"" said one crew member. Knowing where the water is flowing from is necessary to complete the repairs on the hillside.  District Engineer Frank Gioscio said the DOT's aim is to keep the road open. ""We definitely don't want any more lane closures,"" he said.  A Contractor has been assigned to the repair work and is monitoring the site 24 hours a day to make sure the road stays intact. The slide undercut a portion of one southbound lane but all other lanes are intact and should remain open, said officials.  The mud from the hillside covered Kirby Mountain Road, which sits below and parallel to Highway 321. A barricade is up to keep everyone but those who live down the road from driving on it.

Spooks Branch Road and an area near the intersection of Skyview Place and Sunset Drive, all in North Asheville, experienced landslides earlier this month due to heavy rains. Both instances resulted in lane or road closures. Assessment of the projectsÃ• scope began as soon as weather and the soil stability on site permitted. Because of the magnitude of their damage, the Skyview and Spooks Branch locations required working with outside contractors. Ã’We initiated an aggressive schedule,Ã“ said Streets and Engineering Services Manager Greg Shuler. During the bank restoration and repair, some road and lane closures are expected. During that time, barricades and markers will be used to indicate road or lane closures. In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks. Skyview Place and Sunset Drive are also currently closed to through traffic. Surrounding residences may also experience occasional water interruptions during construction. See water service interruption information at http://www.ci.asheville.nc.us/Departments/Water/WaterOutages.aspx. Work is expected to be completed at Spooks Branch Road on September 21, and at Skyview Place on October 21.City of Asheville Public Works crews are working to remediate several other landslide sites in the Town Mountain and Beaverdam Valley areas. In all, landslides affected nearly 20 sites in the city. As of Thursday morning, city crews had completed work on eight of those locations.

The latest slide happened about five miles up the canyon and closed the road from about 11:30 p.m. Friday to 6:30 a.m. Saturday, said Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Adan Carrillo. The slide was not as extensive asÃŠthose that trapped a family and other visitors until about 3 p.m. Friday, though Carrillo said the debris washed over the road in one of the same spots crews had previously cleared. He attributed the slide to the rain that fell late Friday. ""It wasnÃ•t as much rain this time so the cleanup wasnÃ•t as extensive,"" Carrillo added. Monica Traphagan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Snowbird received about 0.7 inch of rain during a storm late Friday. The storm was part of an especially moist air mass moving over Utah. ""ItÃ•s not unheard of,"" Traphagan said of the wetness, ""but itÃ•s certainly unusual for us."" Thursday night and Friday morning, 1.47 inches of rain fell at Alta, which is up-canyon from both rock slides.

The impact of the Friday night slide on traffic was minimal, Carrillo said. Authorities remained on high alert Saturday and were monitoring the area for other potentially dangerous spots. The slides end up blocking the road when drainage areas meant to divert water become clogged with mud, rocks, branches and other debris.

But some people who live around the property at 145 Black Oak Drive say the site is still unstable and the county should do more to prevent another slide like the one that blocked the street this summer and threatened other homes. Remaining fill dirt on the property Ã’is going to go. ThereÃ•s no doubt about it,Ã“ said Billy Fabec, who lives below the property, perched on a steep ridge just north of the city limits. But Michael Frue, chief county staff attorney, says the county has already Ã’gone above and beyondÃ“ and has no obligation to do more. Ã’This is a private road. ItÃ•s a private community. ItÃ•s very steep terrain,Ã“ Frue said. Ã’ThereÃ•s other developments with similar terrain in the county. I think it comes down to whose responsibility is it to maintain a failing slope.Ã“ Landslides have caused damage to homes and roads across Western North Carolina in recent years as construction has climbed ridges and mountainsides to satisfy homebuyersÃ• desire for long-range views and seclusion. Some residents of The Forest subdivision, where the home in question was located, have wonderful views of the Beaverdam Valley and mountains beyond. The homesite where the slide occurred in July is roughly 550 feet higher than the valley floor despite being only about 3,000 away from Beaverdam Road as the crow flies. A Florida contractor used the home as a second residence. He bought the house and its 1.3-acre lot for $432,400 in 2005, according to property records. County government values most homes around the lot at between $270,000 and $500,000. Firefighters warned some subdivision residents they should evacuate their homes after heavy rain in early July saturated soil under the house and it started moving downhill.

Spooks Branch Road and an area near the intersection of Skyview Place and Sunset Drive, all in North Asheville, experienced landslides earlier this month due to heavy rains. Both instances resulted in lane or road closures. Assessment of the projectsÃ• scope began as soon as weather and the soil stability on site permitted. Because of the magnitude of their damage, the Skyview and Spooks Branch locations required working with outside contractors. Ã’We initiated an aggressive schedule,Ã“ said Streets and Engineering Services Manager Greg Shuler. During the bank restoration and repair, some road and lane closures are expected. During that time, barricades and markers will be used to indicate road or lane closures. In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks. Skyview Place and Sunset Drive are also currently closed to through traffic. Surrounding residences may also experience occasional water interruptions during construction. See water service interruption information at http://www.ci.asheville.nc.us/Departments/Water/WaterOutages.aspx.

Now, it's the nearby trees. Officials say a subterranean landslide that closed the Murrysville road to through traffic continues to worsen. Recently, a large tree near the slide toppled over the road, and several others in the area have become unstable. About 130 feet of Twin Oaks Drive between Acorn Lane and Bridgewood Drive began to crumble in early April. Municipal engineer Joe Dietrick said an unstable geological formation, plus the way the road was built, contributed to the problem. Ã’It's definitely not done,Ã“ Dietrick said. Ã’It's going to keep moving until it's happy.Ã“ Dietrick said it would be cost prohibitive to try to restore the road to its preslide condition. Ã’It's so deep that a fix would be astronomical,Ã“ he said. Chief administrator Jim Morrison, who attributed the slide to water washing part of the road away, said the best option for municipal officials is to convert the road into two cul-de-sacs. Officials plan to set aside $200,000 for the project over the next two years but said they don't know how much final repairs and alterations will cost. Dietrick said he hopes that the road Ã‘ which will remain closed between Acorn Lane and Bridgewood Drive Ã‘ will settle enough that work can begin in 2014.

The bad news is that the spring has changed direction, and new soil brought in to hold the hillside in place is pulling groundwater from the spring and it is getting heavier and heavier, and the hillside needs corrective action soon or the new fix might become destabilized.  ""The situation has changed,"" Allen told council. Daniel Barnes, engineer on the project, said that perhaps two gallons per minute are coming down the slope. He described two options for stabilizing the situation, and Allen told council cost of the fixes would be $77,000.  Mayor pro tem Butch Berry, sitting in for vacationing Mayor Morris Pate, asked council to vote on an ordinance to waive competitive bidding and approve the funds for the project because it is an emergency. Alderman Lany Ballance suggested it might be worthwhile to get bids and see if there is a better way to fix the problem.  Alderman James DeVito countered that he is concerned that the city has already made a large investment, and he doesn't want to see the city lose that investment by waiting.  ""The earth will not wait for us,"" he pointed out.  Engineer Dee Purkeypile, also familiar with the project, agreed with both Ballance and DeVito. He said that normally, it would be a good idea to get bids, but he pointed out that the contractor, Johnson Landscaping, already has equipment on site and knows what the engineers have in mind.  ""The soil is moving and it will continue to move,"" he said, and he recommended moving forward as quickly as possible.  Alderman Ken Pownall said he felt uncomfortable voting on an ordinance when he wasn't sure Public Works had done its homework.  DeVito answered that three city streets are involved and he felt council would be looking out for the best interests of the city by approving the ordinance.  The ordinance passed 4-2 with Pownall and Ballance voting No.  Lawnmower blues  Cemetery Commission secretary Mary Ann Pownall gave her financial report and made another appeal to council for funds to purchase a new lawnmower to maintain the 40-acre cemetery. Tom Reynolds, who mows the cemetery, told council that the best deal he could find would cost $4,500 plus tax and warranty for a basic heavy-duty mower. The mower is available from a company in Berryville.  ""We really need to get this gentleman the equipment he needs,"" Ballance said. DeVito suggested that they wait until a budget review, but Ballance insisted, ""I don't want to postpone it, postpone it, postpone it! We need to appropriate it now.""  Alderman Parker Raphael agreed, saying, ""He needs the mower now. He's going to get it, so why wait?""  Pownall moved to transfer $5,000 from the capital fund to purchase the mower.  DeVito insisted that he wanted to find the money first.  ""They'll get their mower, but we need to do it in an orderly fashion,"" he said. ""In all respect to the Cemetery Commission, I don't think the grass is going to grow that fast in the next couple of weeks.""  Nevertheless, council voted to instruct City Attorney Tim Weaver to write an ordinance during a brief recess which would make funds available for the mower. When he returned, Weaver told council he was not confident that they were not asking him to write an illegal ordinance, adding that he did not know where the money was coming from or what line item in the budget it would be going to. No one could answer that question and no one from the Finance Department was available, so Weaver cautioned council to think before voting.  Council reconvened Tuesday at 5 p.m., and Berry introduced a resolution which would transfer a total of $5,500 to the Cemetery Commission capital equipment fund for the purchase of the new lawnmower. Pownall moved to approve the resolution and the motion passed 5-0, with DeVito being absent from the special meeting.

The mud and rock pile, which came down Tuesday afternoon, blocked the tracks about 10 miles south of Silverton.

There was a mudslide on Main Street in downtown Ansonia, numerous flooded homes and vehicles on Derbyâ€™s Seymour Avenue and dangerous arcing power lines on Wakelee Avenue. There were no injuries reported. The storm was similar to a freakish storm that damaged Seymour July 8.  This time, however, Seymour was mostly spared, according to officials at Town Hall. This time Mother Nature focused on Ansonia and Derby exclusively.  â€œThis was the worst storm Iâ€™ve seen in Ansonia all my life,â€ said Ansonia Assistant Fire Chief Michael Eheman. â€œI canâ€™t remember hail for the length of time we were getting it. Normally they last five minutes and itâ€™s gone. I would say this had to be a good 15 or 20 minutes.â€  The rains came down heavy from 6:45 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., said Ron Culmo, Derbyâ€™s public works director.  The fast and heavy rainfall inundated storm drains, causing widespread flash flooding.  The residue of all the flooding made for a massive, all-day clean up job Tuesday.  â€œWeâ€™re cleaning up right now, Seymour Avenue, Hawthorne Avenue, Spring Street, Elizabeth Street â€” the water was like two-feet high in the middle of the road,â€ Culmo said. â€œThere was big flooding by Apollo Pizza and the Dewdrop Inn (off Route 34), because storm drains were not big enough to handle the water at one time,â€ Culmo said.  Wires Down!  Wires and electrical lines arcing were a problem throughout Ansonia and Derby.  In Derby, a tree came down across the entrance of the Sons of Italy Club at 73 High Street, taking live wires with it.  â€œThere were 12 people still inside the parking lot, they couldnâ€™t leave until United Illuminating cleared it out at roughly 11 oâ€™clock,â€ said Derby Assistant Chief Kurt Kemmesies Jr.  â€œThe fire calls were overwhelming last night,â€ said Eileen Krugel, a firefighter for Ansonia who is also grant writer for the city.  Eheman said the fire calls did not slow down until 11 p.m.  A few public buildings also suffered some flood damage, including a leaking roof at the Ansonia Armory, where some ceiling tiles came down, and water seeping through the doors around Ansonia City Hall.  Live wires fell to the ground at the intersection of Wakelee and Hull Street in Ansonia Monday, causing a spectacular display of sparks and flames. Luckily, no one was injured.  The live wires sparked and jumped around, as the Ansonia Fire Department waited for the utility company to cut the power.  Several people were inside the home at the time, but because the wires were close to the front door, they couldnâ€™t safely get out of the house, according to Valley Indy reader, Walt Smith.  Smith happened to be driving through the area after power lines were downed in front of a Wakelee Avenue home.  So he did what any earnest Valley Indy reader would do: He grabbed his video camera, shot some video of the scene and posted it to the Valley Indy Facebook page.  Here is Smithâ€™s video:  The wires were touching a metal fence that ran along the outside of the property, and Ansonia firefighters were trying to communicate with people inside the home.  The people couldnâ€™t come out the front door because thatâ€™s where the live wires were, Smith said.

A portion of the roof over the drive-through section of the restaurant suffered damage about 8:15 p.m. There was some five inches of water on the building itself, which seeped into the restaurant, causing ceiling tiles inside to collapse.  Workers at the scene Tuesday morning were mopping up water from the floors, saying they did not know when the restaurant would reopen.  The nearby McDonaldâ€™s restaurant, on Division Street in Derby, also got whacked.  The entire Division Street area was flooded with about 4.5 feet of water at about 7:30 p.m., according to firefighters.  McDonaldâ€™s manager Nancy Contreras said the restaurant had to close between 9 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. to clean up flooding in the customer lobby.  â€œThe water was this deep,â€ she said, showing a depth of several inches with her finger gestures.",,Known_within_50_km,Small,,glc,3870,United States,Wellsboro,0.17013,Pennsylvania,Tioga County,3263,US,NA,SGarJtmK4,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,41.749699999999997,-77.299000000000007,"(41.749699999999997, -77.299000000000007)"

County Roads 320 (the Rifle-Rulison Road), 115 (Red Canyon Road) and 100 (Catherine Store Road) in Missouri Heights were closed in late July as a result of mudslides and rockfalls along certain stretches.  Public Works Director Betsy Suerth got permission on Monday from the Garfield Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) to spent an estimated $2 million to fix the roads, and to do so in an â€œexpedited mannerâ€ to get the roads open to the public as quickly as possible.  â€œI believe that the damages have caused unsafe conditions and pose a threat to the safety of the public,â€ Suerth told the BOCC.  County attorney Andrew Gorgey assured the BOCC that state law does allow for such shortcuts in the case of emergencies.  That means the county's normal procurement system, in particular the advertisement for requests for proposals from interested contractors, will be skipped.  In fact, one contract, for $459,548 to fix the Rifle-Rulison Road, was awarded on Monday to the Con-Sy Inc. company of Rifle.  Con-Sy was the low bidder in a list of three firms, which included Frontier Paving and Aspen Earth Moving.  Commissioner Mike Samson, agreeing with the other two commissioners that â€œwe definitely have to do something,â€ balked at spending $2 million so quickly.  â€œIs there another approach to this?â€ he asked.  Although the contract for one road already has been awarded, Garfield County procurement officer Jim Hackett said it will be another 10 days before the same could be done for the other two roads.  In the meantime, Commissioner John Martin suggested that the need to fix Red Canyon Road, in particular, should be examined.  â€œThat has been deemed an argument since the creation of 115 Road itself,â€ he remarked. â€œDoes it really need to be open, because it's such a dangerous road.â€  Garfield County officials have debated the subject for years, bickering about the narrow road enclosed by steep canyon walls that, on one side, form a sheer drop to the floor far below. In winter, the steep canyon walls allows in little sun to melt accumulated snow and ice, making the road even more treacherous.  County Manager Ed Green said the county could look at rebuilding Red Canyon Road to make it safer, a project he predicted could cost as much a $28 million.  No decisions were made other than a unanimous vote to award the Rifle-Rulison Road project to Con-Sy, for $459,548. With other costs not included in the contract, the project is to cost up to $650,000.  jcolson@postindependent.com ",,Known_within_10_km,Small,,glc,3867,United States,Rifle,1.11647,Colorado,Garfield,9172,US,NA,DJn_h9mQW,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,39.525599999999997,-107.77760000000001,"(39.525599999999997, -107.77760000000001)"

The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) accepted bids for the project Monday and expected work to begin by Wednesday or Thursday, said Mike Hermes, trails and facilities manager. The trail was covered by 15 slides in a 1.5-mile stretch when more than 2 inches of rain fell in an hour in the late-afternoon cloudburst last month. Three of the slides were major, with one dumping boulders, rocks and mud up to 25 feet on the trail. Another dozen were â€œnuisance slidesâ€ that RFTA deals with regularly, Hermes said.  The trail between Rock Bottom Ranch and Catherine Bridge has been closed since the slides. Through traffic on the popular trail has been sent on a detour that involves Willits Lane, Valley Road, old Highway 82 and Catherine Road. The detour routes riders around a 3.5-mile stretch of the trail.  Hermes said RFTA has fielded numerous telephone calls inquiring when the trail will open again.  At this point, it doesn't appear that major sections of the trail must be rebuilt. â€œMost of the trail appears to be intact,â€ Hermes said. The asphalt on a section he estimated to be 30 feet long was damaged and will be opened this year with road base, a crushed type of gravel. A longer-term solution will be undertaken at a later date.  â€œI just want to get it open as soon as I can,â€ Hermes said.

A massive mudslide closed down Highway 145 just west of Telluride for eight hours on Monday night and into Tuesday morning, and another closed the only road into Ophir. And an apparent lightning strike knocked out the Mill Creek Water Treatment Plant Monday night, shutting it down and putting the town on its backup system.  â€œThe plant is currently not operating and we are awaiting a new power supply which will be shipped overnight. As we will be operating exclusively on our back up system (Stillwell) for the next couple days, it could be a challenge to meet water demand,â€ wrote Town Manager Greg Clifton in a memo Tuesday. â€œThe Town would like to ask its citizens and visitors to please conserve water while we make the necessary repairs.  Outdoor irrigation, as one example, could likely be curtailed for a temporary time frame considering the monsoonal weather patterns.â€  When the summer monsoons pound down with such ferocity as Monday, the water becomes too much for the hillsides to handle, resulting in mudslides on steep slopes. The backup treatment system, Stillwell, has about three-quarters the storage and treatment potential of the Mill Creek facility, which can treat about 750,000 gallons per day and store up to one million. According to Clifton, the town of Telluride can exceed a million gallons of water use on a busy and hot summer day.  The town is awaiting a new power supply for the plant and is encouraging water users to make due with less â€” no outdoor irrigation, for example.  â€œWeâ€™re definitely going into a water conservation mode,â€ said Mayor Stu Fraser. â€œJust cut back as much as you can in any way that you can.â€  MUDSLIDE CLOSES ROAD  The mudslide ran across the highway near the Illium Road turnoff, with the most severe mud coming east of Deep Creek Road. Colorado Department of Transportation crews and San Miguel County Sheriffâ€™s deputies worked from 6:30 p.m. on Monday to just after 3 a.m. Tuesday morning to clear the roads.  No one was hurt in the slides, according to the San Miguel County Sheriffâ€™s Office. Todd Jones, of CDOT, said crews moved 800 square yards of debris from the highway.  Traffic was stopped at Keystone Hill and drivers were advised to drive around the Telluride Regional Airport to Last Dollar Road. There were mudslides on the alternate routes as well according to reports, though they were smaller.  â€œAs long as the weatherâ€™s still good and itâ€™s not raining heavily, thatâ€™s the preferred detour,â€ said Jennifer Dinsmore, the public relations officer with the sheriffâ€™s office.  The sheriffâ€™s office encourages drivers to pack a kit with food, water and warm clothes or a sleeping bag in the event they get stuck.  â€œKnow your alternate routes,â€ Dinsmore said, adding that thereâ€™s no stock advice for mudslides because sometimes itâ€™s dangerous to either stay in oneâ€™s car or flee. â€œYou just have to use your best judgment,â€ she said.

The local media reported that three other people had been injured in a separate mudslide.  Troops and Red Cross teams brought hot food and other basic supplies to Salina Cruz residents while the Oaxacan state government recommended that the federal government declare a state of emergency in several parts of the department.  Forecasters expect the rain to continue for at least another day.   Bookmark and Share  Blog   Forum Give Comments      ~~~~Oaxaca â€“  At least three people died and more than 180,000 others were affected by the torrential rains that hit southern Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec over the weekend, officials in Oaxaca state said.  Two people died in Salina Cruz, a city southeast of Oaxaca city, the state capital, and one person died in San Jose Chiltepec, north of the capital, Gov. Gabino Cue said.  Gabriel Lopez Estudillo, 82, and his daughter, Sandra Luz Lopez Luca, 34, died when a mudslide buried their house in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region.  A woman died when she was swept away early Sunday by a river in San Jose Chiltepec, a city in the Papaloapan Basin region near the border with Veracruz state.  Emergency management officials plan to survey families affected by the rains to determine their needs once the clean-up is completed, Cue said.  An emergency declaration was requested on Sunday for 42 of Oaxaca's 570 municipalities so federal reconstruction assistance can be obtained, state government secretary-general Irma PiÃ±eyro Arias said.  The torrential rains ""have caused damage to dwellings and the main access routes to areas affected by the storm,"" PiÃ±eyro Arias said.  Army troops activated an emergency plan to assist residents of cities in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the area most affected by the heavy rains from a tropical wave.  Health Secretariat teams have fanned out across the region, providing medical care and disease prevention services to residents affected by flooding in Salina Cruz, Tehuantepec and neighboring cities, such as San Mateo del Mar, San Pedro Huamelula and Santiago Astata, among others, officials said.  Oaxaca Infrastructure Secretariat and water commission personnel are moving heavy equipment and trucks into affected areas as part of the clean-up operation.  A mudslide blocked the Istmo-Huatulco highway in the city of Salina Cruz, making it difficult to access the area.  Several rivers and streams have overflowed their banks in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region, with water levels reaching 1.5 meters (nearly five feet) in some places.  The torrential rains that hit the region over the weekend were produced by tropical wave No. 9, which affected southern, southeastern and central Mexico.

But the town and the valley will be able to pull clean drinking water from the high Lasky Gulch for at least a few months while waiting for the sediment from the slide to clear.  â€œThe immediate concern was the question: Was it a large enough slide to where it could deposit enough material to create a blockage on Straight Creek?â€ Dillon town manager Devin Granbery said. â€œThere would be a potential for the build up of water behind a blockage and then a release. and there was a potential for damage to property and life safety issues there.â€  A release of water from a behind a landslide dam could also damage the Dillon and Dillon Valley diversion plants downstream, which pull water from the creek to be filtered for drinking water.  Fortunately, the slide did not create a blockage, according to Forest Service hydrology experts.  The town will pull drinking water primarily from Lasky Gulch because the sediment still in the creek from the slide can be damaging to the diversion plants.  The town has also left an excavator off Interstate 70 near the site of the slide, which will be able to remove a blockage quickly if the slide moves farther into the creek.  â€œWe feel pretty confident at this point that there's no immediate threat to life or property,â€ Granbery said.  But the towns of Silverthorne and Dillon both have to confront the long-term impacts of the heavy sediment spilled into the water, which, once the creek feeds into the Blue River, could eventually threaten Silverthorne's fisheries.  It is unclear what caused the slide. Granbery said it might have been the rain and moisture in recent weeks, erosion from the beetle kill, a slackening of the soil as the ground thawed or a combination of factors.  Dillon is working with the county, Silverthorne, the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Forest Service as well as local utility companies to ensure power lines and other infrastructure in the area aren't damaged and to begin to find ways to deal with the long-term problems posed by the sediment.  â€œWe have to be working with all those agencies involved to see what are the long-term impacts of the landslide,â€ Granbery said. â€œWe may be piping sedimentation ponds to help us with long-term treatment of water. Eventually it will revegetate itself. It's a normal occurrence, but for a few years we'll be dealing with some sedimentation issues.â€ ",,Known_within_5_km,Small,,glc,3743,United States,Silverthorne,2.66276,Colorado,Summit County,3887,US,NA,D5a0h5dKW,1,Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC),1,39.631,-106.0433,"(39.631, -106.0433)"

The slides, which covered the roads with mud, rocks and debris, were triggered by strong thunderstorms.  Scott Thompson with the Utah Department of Transportation said the canyon received about 2 inches of rain Tuesday night, which was too much for the already-saturated hillsides. UDOT crews had been expecting slides in the canyon because they happen every year, but five slides in one night was unusual.  UDOT crews were able to clear enough mud off one lane to get stranded campers and bikers down the canyon, said UDOT spokesman Nile Easton.  Some motorists were reportedly stranded at Tibble Fork for several hours.  But to get the heavy portions of debris off the road, bulldozers and heavy equipment were used to scoop mud -- which was 7 feet deep and 200 feet wide in some spots -- off the road, he said.  The road was closed at the turnoff to Timpanogos Cave visitors center, Easton said.

Citiparks director Mike Radley said the pool could reopen as soon as Friday. The facility has been closed since heavy weekend rainfall triggered the mudslide about 7:30 p.m. Monday. Muddy water rushed down a hill next to the Magee Community Center and through a chain-link fence around the park's perimeter, Mr. Radley said.  The mudslide didn't knock down any trees or cause any serious damage to the community center, Mr. Radley said, but it left ""a good bit of brush, dirt and debris"" behind.  While Magee Community Center staff and employees from the Citiparks aquatics division and the Department of Public Works have succeeded in clearing out Magee's park, the swimming pool has required more work.  ""Draining the pool was necessary,"" Mr. Radley said. ""We have to clean the pool shell, hose down the pool and get it ready for fresh water.""  Once the pool is refilled, the water must be fully sanitized and chlorinated.  Except for a few inches of murky brown water in the deep end, the pool was empty Wednesday afternoon. A woman was scrubbing the pool with a hose and push broom.  The pool, which has a capacity of 476 swimmers, is usually well-attended in the summer, Mr. Radley said.  Sam Rothaus, who lives just minutes away from the Magee pool on nearby McCaslin Street, also said the pool is regularly packed with ""kids of all age groups."" She walked to the community center with her swimsuit-clad son Elijah, 8, and daughter Sadie, 6, Wednesday afternoon, only to find the pool empty and the community center deserted.  ""We just went down there and they're cleaning it, so we couldn't go down there,"" Sadie said, holding a large beach towel.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Sunday that the Ohio Emergency Management Agency estimates the county has $7.4 million in damage. Statewide, the estimate is at $43 million.  The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.  In the Cincinnati region, including northern Kentucky, 41.04 inches of rain have fallen since the start of the year, twice the amount that had fallen over the same time period in 2010 and slightly more than the average 12-month rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.  â€œItâ€™s possible weâ€™ll exceed the all-time wettest year on record,â€ said Don Hughes, a meteorologist technician with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.  Part of an infrastructure tax, prompted by a 1986-87 business study, nets about $700,000 a year in Cincinnati and has helped fund a program that works to stabilize against landslides, The Enquirer reports.  Since the program started, the city has stabilized more than 60 locations, said Rich Pohana, Cincinnatiâ€™s geotechnical engineer.  â€œIf those slides were not stabilized this would have been much more dramatic,â€ he said.

The most outstanding feature of this so-called Bolivarian revolution has been the lack of investment in development plans in any of the areas that are vital to the country. As a consequence, PDVSA, the national electricity system, the public transportation system, the potable water system, the sewage system, and garbage collection (or lack of it) are all showing serious signs of deterioration, this being the hallmark of ChÃ¡vezâ€™s style of government. Much less has there been any urban planning that takes into account the public services that will be required as a result of natural population growth.  Another area that reflects the failure of the â€œrevolutionâ€™sâ€ government is the countryâ€™s infrastructure, particularly the roads. Here the Bolivarians have not hit on ways to maintain existing infrastructure or to invest in the building of new roads. It is no longer just that it let the Caracas-La Guaira Viaduct collapse or that it failed to find a lasting solution to the problem of La Cabrera Tunnel or that it turned a deaf ear to warnings by experts of the risks posed by the bridges over the Orinoco River and Lake Maracaibo. Now people all around the country are suffering the consequences of the governmentâ€™s ineptitude, finding themselves penned in because urban and interurban roads are full of potholes, blocked by landslides or have partly disappeared after huge chunks have fallen into the abyss. Some weeks ago, the national press reported that MÃ©rida was completely cut off owing to landslides on the road that connects it to Barinitas and Barinas. Another landslide kept the stretch of the Charallave National Highway that links it up with the Central Regional Highway closed between July 3 and July 9, complicating things for traffic going to Maracay and Valencia.  Last week, part of the Valle-Coche Freeway, in the area of Fuerte Tiuna, collapsed owing to a mega hole -more than 2 meters deep and two lanes wide- caused by a burst water pipe (for which Hidrocapital is responsible).  Now people are warning of the risk the Pan-American Highway (Los Teques-Caracas) is running of collapsing owing to a huge hole at Km 25, which started to appear a year ago and has already eaten away two lanes.

But, nothing could have prepared her for what jolted her to action around 3 a.m. Wednesday.  â€œI heard the telephone pole go and heard the land slip and then boom, boom, boom,â€ Keith said.

But, Keith wasn't the only one affected. Along with her yard, her trees and her fence went -- downed power lines knocking out electricity to hundreds of homes on Huntington's Southside.  While Keith owns the top part of the hill, Cabell Huntington Hospital owns the bottom two-thirds. Cleaning up the mess truly will be a team effort.  â€œWe have fallen victim to the heavy rainfall that has plagued many other places,"" said Charles Shumaker, a spokesperson for Cabell Huntington Hospital.

Highway engineers say damage to KY 93 between the 8 and 9 mile marker south of Eddyville is so serious the project is more about rebuilding the roadway rather than repairing it.  The heavy rain that lead to near-record flooding across the region saturated the soil causing the roadway to drop as much as 10 feet along about a 1500-foot section of highway in the Eddy Creek area.  Early estimates indicate the cost of repair will be about $600,000.  This week, a contractor that specializes in landslide repair has drilled and placed steel posts into the slide area to help stabilize the soil.  Starting Monday the crew will drive pilings along the lower edge of the slide to further stabilize the area.  Once a retaining wall is constructed, the area will be back filled and compacted to help reduce the possibility of future slides developing at the site.  Engineers say the highway may be closed until July while the work is completed.  KY 93 is a popular route for tourists coming to Lake Barkley. It runs through southern Lyon County and serves a number of resorts and marinas.  The closure adds about 12 miles to a trip between Eddyville and Eddy Creek.  -----  The highway south of Eddyville near Eddy Bay has been shut down since April 25 after what state officials term a â€œmajor landslideâ€ affected the road suface.  â€¦ The roadâ€™s surface dropped by as much as 10 feet along a 1,500-foot section of the highway after heavy rain saturated the soil along a fill area.

Cornejo said last week that the rains have caused flooding, sinking and landslides that are affecting about 1,000 people in the country's mountain regions.  However, she said the number of affected might be larger, as authorities lack a ""precise record"" because there are people living in isolated communities.  According to SNGR figures, Quito, the capital of the South American country, suffered most from heavy rains, with 282 families at risk.
