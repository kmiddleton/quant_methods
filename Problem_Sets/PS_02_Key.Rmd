## Setup

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Silence some warnings
options(warn = -1)
```

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
# Load packages in this R code chunk
# Come back here and include the commands to load all the packages
# you will need to complete this problem set. I like to load all the
# packages I will need for an analysis at the top.

# FIXME
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
library("cowplot")
```

## Working Directory

By default, R will read and write files from its working directory. The status of the current directory can be found at the top of the Console window. You can also check the current working directory with the command `getwd()`.

### Best practices

Store all the files for an analysis (problem set) in a single directory. You might have the following directory structure:

- Quant_Meth_LifeSci
    - Lecture_Slides
    - Docs
    - Problem_Sets
        - PS_01
            - `PS_1.Rmd`
            - other files
        - PS_02
            - `PS_02.Rmd`
            - other files
        - PS_03, etc.

Then set the R working directory to the current active file using the RStudio menus: **Session $\rightarrow$ Set Working Directory $\rightarrow$ To Source File Location**.

Setting the working directory to the location of the current files will ensure that you can directly access the data files from the local folder, and that any files which are written will be in that directory.

As you get more comfortable with R, you can move files around, use sub-directories, etc. For now, keep it simple and store associated files in the same directory, even if this means duplicating files (which is something you definitely don't want to do in general practice).

### Activity

Organize your files and set the working directory to the directory where this file and the required data files for this problem set are located.

```{r}
getwd()
```

## Loading Packages

> In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. As of January 2015, there were over 6,000 packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, the public clearing house for R packages. This huge variety of packages is one of the reasons that R is so successful: the chances are that someone has already solved a problem that youâ€™re working on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading their package. (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html)

The `library()` function with the following syntax is used to load packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

Packages much be installed before they can be loaded. If you get a message like:

> `Error in library("tidyverse") : there is no package called 'tidyverse'`

It means that the package is not installed. First install the package (note that the quotes are required):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

and then rerun the code chunk that includes the `library()` commands. cowplot is a package that changes some of the ggplot defaults to be a little more friendly.

### Best practices (things to remember)

- Packages only need to be installed once on each computer. They are stored locally.
- Packages need to be loaded (`library()`) each time you restart R. Loaded packages are not persistent across R sessions.
- Load all of the packages you need at the start of a document to keep track of what packages your analysis needs.

### Activity

In the *Setup* section at the beginning of this document, add code to load the following packages, which you will need for this problem set:

1. `tidyverse`
1. `readxl`
1. `cowplot`

Install these packages if you need to (see **Loading Packages** above for the installation syntax). 

## Loading Data

Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) refers to the difference in size between males and females of the same species. Spiders show some of the most dramatic cases where females are larger than males. 

The golden silk orb weaver (*Nephila clavipes*) is a spider that shows extreme SSD, in which males are about 2/3 smaller than females. This picture shows the size disparity:

<div style="width:350px">
![](http://djringer.com/photos/d/8304-2/golden-silk-orbweaver-nephila-clavipes-female-male.jpg)
</div>


In contrast, in the wolf spider (*Pardosa ramulosa*), males and females do not show large size differences.

<div style="width:350px">

</div>


The file `Size_Dimorphism.xlsx` contains data on body mass and body length for males and females in these two species. 


### Activity

Using the `read_excel()` function, load the file `Size_Dimorphism.xlsx` in R. Assign it to the object, `M`.

```{r}
#FIXME
M <- read_excel("../data/Size_Dimorphism.xlsx")
```

## Exploring Data

Any time you load data from an external source (which is almost every time you are working with data), you should check to make sure that the data has been correctly imported.

You can use two functions to get a quick overview of the columns of a `data.frame` (any R object really), `str()` and `glimpse()`, each of which gives a list of the columns and their first few values.

### Activity

Type `str(M)` into the code chunk below and then compile

```{r}
#FIXME
str(M)
```


Using the output of `str(M)`, answer the following questions.

- How many rows are in the `data.frame` `M`?

> 200

- Does this agree with the number of rows in the Excel file? Why or why not?

> Excel has the header row separate. But the number of data rows matches.

- How many columns are in the `data.frame` `M`? Does this agree with the number of columns in the Excel file? Why or why not?

> 5. This matches. No header issues.

## Number of Observations per Group

This experiment is balanced, meaning there are equal numbers of males and females in each species (50 of each). 

### Activity 

Check that this is the case by creating a logical and summing it. i.e. how many female *Nephila clavipes* are there? 

```{r}
#FIXME
sum(M$Sex=='F' & M$Species=='Nephila_clavipes')
sum(M$Sex=='M' & M$Species=='Nephila_clavipes')
sum(M$Sex=='F' & M$Species=='Pardosa_ramulosa')
sum(M$Sex=='M' & M$Species=='Pardosa_ramulosa')

```

Looks like something is not right. There are a few ways to figure out what might be going on. Try using the unique function to check for typos in the Sex column. If you pass a vector to `unique()` it will return all unique values. The result should be just two values: "M", and "F". Use the which function to identify the obsevations with typos. (`%in%` might be useful here but there are other ways to do this)

```{r}
#FIXME
unique(M$Sex)

M[which(!(M$Sex %in% c('F','M'))),'ID']

```

You could use the results of your which functions to find and correct your excel file after making a back up copy just in case you make a mistake (or use version control!). If you were planning to do more editing in excel, this would be preferable. For this exercise will correct these within R here. We've given you the syntax for fixing one. Use this same format to fix the others. Run `unique()` again to make sure you got them all. 

```{r}

M$Sex[M$Sex=='F ']<-'F'
#FIXME
M$Sex[M$Sex=='M ']<-'M'
M$Sex[M$Sex=='f ']<-'F'
M$Sex[M$Sex=='f']<-'F'
M$Sex[M$Sex=='m ']<-'M'
M$Sex[M$Sex=='m']<-'M'

```

Now check the Species column in the same way. Fix any errors that you find.

```{r}

unique(M$Species)

M$Species[M$Species=='Pardosa_ramuloso']<-'Pardosa_ramulosa'
M$Species[M$Species=='Pardosa ramulosa']<-'Pardosa_ramulosa'
M$Species[M$Species=='Pardosa_ramulosa ']<-'Pardosa_ramulosa'

unique(M$Species)


```

One big reason to be careful when you enter data!!

One last step, let's write out your new, typo-free data. Look at the help for `write_csv()` and write out your data to a new csv file named, Size_Dimorphism_corrected.csv. 

```{r}

write_csv(M, "../data/Size_Dimorphism_corrected.csv")

```

Now read your new file back in as if this next section is a new script. Feel free to overwrite your previous object, `M`. This is a good idea to avoid confusion. Use `read_csv()`.

```{r}
M <- read_csv("../data/Size_Dimorphism_corrected.csv")
```

## Data Counts

Another way to get counts by group uses `group_by()` and `tally()`. `group_by()` splits data by factors and tally adds the number of observations in each of those groups. 

### Activity

In the chunk below, pipe `M` to `group_by()`, grouping by both species and sex. Then pipe that to `tally()`. `tally()` does not require any arguments when used this way.

```{r}
#FIXME
M %>% group_by(Species, Sex) %>% tally()

```

You should now see 50 observations per sex within species. 

## Data Filtering

To give you some practice filtering, filter your data in the following ways using *both* base R and tidyverse functions. 

1. All *Pardosa ramulosa* 
2. All females of both species
3. Body mass and sex for *Nephila clavipes*
4. Rows 1-50
5. Mass of the largest female in each species
6. Male *Pardosa ramulosa* with body lengths less than 4 or greater than 6

```{r}
#FIXME
# 1
M[M$Species == "Pardosa_ramulosa", ]
M %>% filter(Species == "Pardosa_ramulosa")

# 2
M[M$Sex == "F", ]
M %>% filter(Sex == "F")

# 3
M[M$Species == "Nephila_clavipes", c("BodyMass", "Sex")]
M %>% filter(Species == "Nephila_clavipes") %>% 
  select(BodyMass, Sex)

# 4
M[1:50, ]
M %>% slice(1:50)

# 5
max(M[M$Sex=='F' & M$Species=='Pardosa_ramulosa','BodyMass'])
max(M[M$Sex=='F' & M$Species=='Nephila_clavipes','BodyMass'])
M %>% filter(Sex == "F") %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(max_BodyMass = max(BodyMass))

# 6
M[M$Species == "Pardosa_ramulosa" & 
    M$Sex == "M" &
    (M$BodyLength < 4 | M$BodyLength > 6), ]
M %>% filter(Species == "Pardosa_ramulosa" & Sex == "M") %>% 
  filter(BodyLength < 4 | BodyLength > 6)
```

## Plotting histograms

To start looking at sexual size dimorphism, we will make some histograms. 

###Activity

Start with a histogram of body length overall. 

```{r}

#FIXME
ggplot(M, aes(BodyLength))+
  geom_histogram()

```

There are some obvious groupings here but we don't know which species or sex they represent. We need to separate both species and sex. One approach is to make a plot for each species with `fill` denoting sex. Try this.

```{r}

#FIXME
M %>% 
  filter(Species=='Pardosa_ramulosa') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(BodyLength, fill=Sex)) +
  geom_histogram()

M %>% 
  filter(Species=='Nephila_clavipes') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(BodyLength, fill=Sex)) +
  geom_histogram()
  

```

We could also visualize all groups with `facet_grid()`. Here is an example:

```{r}
ggplot(M, aes(BodyLength)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_grid(Sex~Species)
```

With this you can clearly see SSD in Nephila but not in Pardosa. 

## Aggregating

The simplest descriptive statistics are means and standard deviations. Calculate these for body length per each species per each sex. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()`. 

```{r}

M %>% group_by(Sex, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean(BodyLength), sd(BodyLength))

```


## Scatterplot

You might be interested in the relationship between body length and body mass. Create a scatterplot of these two variables. Use color to show Sex and facet by Species. Put body length on the x axis. 

```{r}

ggplot(M, aes(x=BodyLength, y=BodyMass, color=Sex)) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(Species~.)


```

Describe the patterns you observe. Do you think this is a useful visualization? Why or why not?


> 


Because body length and body mass are related by an exponential power, if we log transform the data, that will linearize the relationship. Make two new variables that are the log-10 transformations of body length and body mass using `mutate` and plot the data again. 

```{r}

M <- mutate(M, logMass = log10(BodyMass), logLength = log10(BodyLength)) 

#or with a pipe

M <- M %>% mutate(logMass = log10(BodyMass), logLength = log10(BodyLength)) 
ggplot(M, aes(x=logLength, y=logMass, color=Sex)) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(Species~.)


```

What does this plot tell you? Do you think this is a more effective visualization of the data? 

> 

Now add lines of best fit and transparency (`alpha`) to your points. 

```{r}

ggplot(M, aes(x=logLength, y=logMass, color=Sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha=1/3)+
  facet_grid(Species~.)+
  geom_smooth(method='lm')


```

What do these regression lines tell you?
