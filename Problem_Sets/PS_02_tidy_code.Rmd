<!-- THIS CHUNK COMMENTED BELOW IS NOT DONE TILL WEEK 3 -->

<!-- ## Data Counts -->

<!-- Another way to get counts by group uses `group_by()` and `tally()`, which are part of tidyverse. `group_by()` splits data by factors (most commonly, but numerics will work as well) and `tally()` adds up the number of observations in each of those groups. -->

<!-- ### Activity -->

<!-- In the chunk below, pipe `M` to `group_by()`, grouping by both species and sex. Then pipe that to `tally()`. `tally()` does not require any arguments when used this way. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #FIXME -->
<!-- M %>% group_by(Species, Sex) %>% tally() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You should now see 50 observations per sex within species.  -->

<!-- THE COMMENTED CHUNK BELOW ISN"T DONE TILL WEEK 3 -->

<!-- ## Aggregating -->

<!-- Along with the minimum, maximum, and range, two of the simplest and most common descriptive statistics are means and standard deviations. -->

<!-- ### Activity -->

<!-- Calculate the mean and standard deviation for body length for each species per each sex. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()`. You should not have to separate the data into two `data.frame`s. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # FIXME -->
<!-- M %>% group_by(Sex, Species) %>% -->
<!--   summarize(mean(BodyLength), sd(BodyLength)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
