Week 1: Reproducible research, programming with data

Goals:
	Introduction to R
		dealing with errors/debugging
	Introduction to programming/reproducibility
	File organization
	Demystifying programming
		programming & learning a language

Problem set:
	Very basic operations
	Installing packages
	Rendering .rmd

Discuss:

  - About us
  - About you - variation in levels
  - Syllabus
  - Typical weekly schedule
  - Gradebook - don't worry about the total
  - Problem sets, groups
  - Peer evals, codes

---

Week 2: Data cleaning, organization, visualization

Goals:

  -

Discuss:

  - Working as a group
  - Keeping up, getting things in
  - data.frame question
  - RStudio projects & working directories & file paths

---

Week 3: Basic probability

Goals:

  - Definitions: information, uncertainty, probability, variation, explained/unexplained
  - Samples vs. populations; Sampling error
  - Univariate distributions: frequency (histogram) vs. probability (density). Every frequency distribution has an underlying probability distribution
  - Shapes of distributions: uniform, bell-shaped, aymppetric, bimodal
  - Randomness, random sampling, IID
  - Probabilities are proportions
  - Addition rule vs. multiplication rule
  - Conditional probabilities and Bayes rule

Discuss:

  - Practice probability, esp. conditional probability / Bayes.

---

Week 4: Likelihood, Bayesian concepts, frequentist framework

Goals:

  - Key considerations
      - Don't lose sight of why we do statistics
      		- We are trying to make conclusions from data
      		- To do that, we need to evaluate the relative support for different models
      		- Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?
      		- oxic alligators
      		- Does an allele have an effect on a phenotype / which set of alleles & genetic architecture best predicts a phenotype
      		- what are the phylogenetic relationships between dog breeds & other canids
      		- what is the most likely species membership of a fossil
      		- your question here - what is your set of possible models?
      		-the frameworks we are going to teach are the ways we figure out the support for the models

      - The analytical solutions in frequentist are the max likelihood solutions (for set of assumptions)
      - Lots of applications don't have analytical solutions
      - Advantages of analytical solutions (computational advances)
      - Randomization?
      	- solutions without computational

    - Potential examples
    	- snake undulation
    	- tree diameter
    	- coin


  - Probability to likelihood
	- Example Binomial likelihood
  	- Example where mean is ML estimate of central tendency

Problem Set:

  - Base R vs. not base R
  - for loop?

Week 5: Applications of three inference frameworks

http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/kingfisher/SamplingNormal.htm


Bayes intro: http://sumsar.net/files/posts/2017-01-15-bayesian-computation-with-stan-and-farmer-jons/stan_exercise.html

Goals:

  - Measures of central tendency (see 03 slide 28)
  - Percentiles and quantiles, quartiles and IQR, boxplots

  - Remind that:
      - Set up 6 cages w/ 6 F in each cage. Weigh all in 1st 3, all in 2nd 3. Do you expect them to be the same? How different?

  - Simulate groups with same mean. Show distribution of difference of means.
  - Simulate groups with different means. Problem set? Repeat.
  - It's more complicated, but lots of questions like this follow t.

  - Simulate t dist via sampling. Show df this way.
  - There is an analytical solution

  - Think about when you have no effect. t-test randomization.
  - Distributions of test statistics: t, F, Chisq
  - Bivariate regression
  - Comparison of two means

Problem set:

  - Optim for regression??

Week 6: Parameter estimation, significance testing

http://www.fharrell.com/2017/02/a-litany-of-problems-with-p-values.html

Goals:

    - OLS, t-test, ANOVA
    - Philosophical aspects of NHST

---

Week 7: Randomization, multiple testing

Goals:

    - Churchill paper
    - Storey

Problem set:

    - Simple permutation test


---

Week 8: Generalized linear models

Goals:

"Despite our best eﬀorts to include information, all models are approximate" Gelman et al.

---

Week 9: Generalized linear models

Goals:

---

Week 10: Model comparison, model based inference

"In comparing nested models, the larger model typically has the advantage of making more sense and ﬁtting the data better but the disadvantage of being more diﬃcult to understand and compute. The key questions of model comparison are typically: (1) is the improvement in ﬁt large enough to justify the additional diﬃculty in ﬁtting, and (2) is the prior distribution on the additional parameters reasonable?" Gelman ARM Book

Goals:

---

Goals:

---

Week 12: Multiple comparisons procedures
