Week 4: Likelihood, Bayesian concepts, frequentist framework

Goals:

  - Key considerations
      - Don't lose sight of why we do statistics
      		- We are trying to make conclusions from data
      		- To do that, we need to evaluate the relative support for different models
      		- Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?
      		- oxic alligators
      		- Does an allele have an effect on a phenotype / which set of alleles & genetic architecture best predicts a phenotype
      		- what are the phylogenetic relationships between dog breeds & other canids
      		- what is the most likely species membership of a fossil
      		- your question here - what is your set of possible models?
      		-the frameworks we are going to teach are the ways we figure out the support for the models

      - The analytical solutions in frequentist are the max likelihood solutions (for set of assumptions)
      - Lots of applications don't have analytical solutions
      - Advantages of analytical solutions (computational advances)
      - Randomization?
      	- solutions without computational

    - Potential examples
    	- snake undulation
    	- tree diameter
    	- coin


  - Probability to likelihood
	- Example Binomial likelihood
  	- Example where mean is ML estimate of central tendency

Problem Set:

  - Base R vs. not base R
  - for loop?

      - Set up 6 cages w/ 6 F in each cage. Weigh all in 1st 3, all in 2nd 3. Do you expect them to be the same? How different?

  - Simulate groups with same mean. Show distribution of difference of means.
  - Simulate groups with different means. Problem set? Repeat.
  - It's more complicated, but lots of questions like this follow t.

  - Simulate t dist via sampling. Show df this way.
  - There is an analytical solution

  - Think about when you have no effect. t-test randomization.
  - Distributions of test statistics: t, F, Chisq
  - Bivariate regression
  - Comparison of two means

Week 9: Model comparison, model based inference

"Despite our best eﬀorts to include information, all models are approximate" Gelman et al. ABD

"The most that can be expected from any model is that it can supply a useful approximation to reality: All models are wrong; some models are useful." Box, Hunter and Hunter (2005; and Box many times previously)

"In comparing nested models, the larger model typically has the advantage of making more sense and ﬁtting the data better but the disadvantage of being more diﬃcult to understand and compute. The key questions of model comparison are typically: (1) is the improvement in ﬁt large enough to justify the additional diﬃculty in ﬁtting, and (2) is the prior distribution on the additional parameters reasonable?" Gelman ARM Book
