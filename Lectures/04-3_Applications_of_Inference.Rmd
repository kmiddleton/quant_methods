## Inferring a mean

Mean undulation rate for $n = 8$ [gliding snakes](http://www.flyingsnake.org/):

```{r}
undulation_rate <- c(0.9, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.6, 2.0)
```

</center>

What is the mean undulation rate for this sample of flying snakes?

## Undulation rate

```{r undulation_plot, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data_frame(undulation_rate), aes(undulation_rate)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Undulation Rate (Hz)", y = "Count")
```

## Analytical inference of mean

Arithmetic mean:

$$\hat{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}{n}$$

$$mean~undulation~rate = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}undulation~rate_i}{n}$$

## Analytical inference of mean

```{r}
sum(undulation_rate) / length(undulation_rate)
mean(undulation_rate)
```

## Maximum likelihood inference of mean

Use `dnorm()` to calculate the relative likelihood of an observed value $Y_i$ drawn from a [normal distribution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html) given a mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$).

$$f\left(Y_i; \mu, \sigma\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}} e^{\frac{-\left(Y_i-\mu\right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}$$

## Standard normal distribution

```{r}
dnorm(0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

```{r normal_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
M <- data_frame(x = seq(-3, 3, length = 100),
                y = dnorm(x))
ggplot(M, aes(x, y)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Y", y = "Relative Likelihood")
```

## Calculating a likelihood

*Hypothesizing that the population mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1*, what is the likelihood of the observed values?

1. This is a model.
2. Calculate the relative likelihood of each observation
3. Model likelihood is the product of the individual likelihoods
4. log-likelihood is more tractable, so calculate that

## Model Likelihood ($\mathcal{L}$)

For a set of observations ($Y_i$) and hypothesized parameters ($\Theta$; i.e., mean and standard deviation) the model likelihood is the product of the observations' individual likelihoods:

$$\mathcal{L}\left(\left\{ Y_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{n};\Theta\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\phi\left(Y_{i}; \Theta\right)$$

$$\log\left(\mathcal{L}\left(\left\{ Y_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{n};\Theta\right)\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log\left(\phi\left(Y_{i};\Theta\right)\right)$$

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

*Hypothesizing that the population mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1*, what is the likelihood of the observed values?

Likelihood for the first observation (`undulation_rate[1]`):

```{r}
undulation_rate[1]
dnorm(undulation_rate[1], mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(M, aes(x, y)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Y", y = "Relative Likelihood") +
  geom_point(aes(x = undulation_rate[1],
                 y = dnorm(undulation_rate[1], mean = 0, sd = 1)),
             color = "red",
             size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = undulation_rate[1],
                   xend = undulation_rate[1],
                   y = 0,
                   yend = dnorm(undulation_rate[1],
                                 mean = 0, sd = 1)),
               color = "red")
```

This is only the likelihood for *one* observation. We need the likelihoods for all `r length(undulation_rate)` undulation rates to get a model likelihood.

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

Vector of likelihoods for all values in `undulation_rate` given `mu = 0` and `sigma = 1`:

```{r}
(rel_liks <- dnorm(undulation_rate, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

Model likelihood is the product of those likelihoods:

```{r}
(lik <- prod(rel_liks))
```

## Likelihood to log-likelihood

```{r}
log(lik)
```

Rather than logging the product, we can sum the log-likelihoods:

```{r}
sum(log(rel_liks))
```

For a model in which the mean is 0 and  standard deviation is 1, the model log-likelihood is `r round(log(lik), 2)`.

## Higher likelihood

Is there another combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that gives a higher likelihood (= larger log-likelihood)?

Try $\mu = 1$ and $\sigma = 1$:

```{r}
sum(log(dnorm(undulation_rate, mean = 1, sd = 1)))
```

This is an improvement over $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a _range_ of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

Find the combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that maximizes the log-likelihood of the model for the mean and standard deviation of undulation rates.

Ranges of possible values:

1. Mean ($\mu$): $-\infty < \mu < \infty$
2. Standard deviation ($\sigma$): $0 < \sigma < \infty$

## Grid approximation

For combinations of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, calculate the model likelihood. Pick the largest log-likelihood as the maximum likelihood estimates.

Set up the grid:

```{r}
n <- 100 # How fine is the grid
mus <- seq(0.1, 5, length = n) # Vector of mu
sigmas <- seq(0.1, 2, length = n) # Vector of sigma

grid_mu_sigma <- mesh(mus, sigmas) # Generate grid

# To hold the output
grid_approx <- data_frame(
  mu = as.numeric(grid_mu_sigma$x),
  sigma = as.numeric(grid_mu_sigma$y),
  log_lik = rep(NA, length = n ^ 2)
)
```

---

```{r}
grid_approx
```

## Grid approximation

```{r grid_approx, cache=TRUE}
for (i in 1:nrow(grid_approx)) {
  grid_approx[i, "log_lik"] <- 
    sum(log(dnorm(undulation_rate,
                  mean = grid_approx$mu[i],
                  sd = grid_approx$sigma[i])))
}
```

- Iterate through the rows ($i$) of `grid_approx`
- For each row, assign the model log-likelihood calculated for that `mu` and `sigma` to `log_lik`

---

```{r}
head(grid_approx)
```

This approach is coarse, time consuming, and not feasible for fine grids or many parameters.

- For a 100 X 100 grid, there are 10,000 calculations.
- If there were 3 parameters, there would be 1,000,000.

## Grid approximation

```{r echo=FALSE}
grid_approx <- do.call(data.frame,
                       lapply(grid_approx,
                              function(x) replace(x, is.infinite(x), NA)))
scatter3D(grid_approx$mu, grid_approx$sigma, grid_approx$log_lik, pch = 16,
          labels = c("mu", "sigma", "log-likelihood"))
```

## Grid approximation

On this grid, the maximum likelihood estimate of $\mu$ is:

```{r}
grid_approx[which.max(grid_approx$log_lik), ]
```

The analytical estimate is:

```{r}
mean(undulation_rate)
```

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

Search for the most likely values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

```{r echo=FALSE}
scatter3D(grid_approx$mu, grid_approx$sigma, grid_approx$log_lik, pch = 16,
          labels = c("mu", "sigma", "log-likelihood"), colkey = FALSE)
```

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

Define a function that takes a vector of values to optimize `x` ($\mu$ and $\sigma$) as well as a set of data `Y` and returns the log-likelihood:

```{r}
log_lik <- function(x, Y){
  probs <- dnorm(Y, mean = x[1], sd = x[2])
  return(sum(log(probs)))
}
```

We can now simultaneously optimize $\mu$ and $\sigma$, maximizing the log-likelihood.

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

`reltol` says to stop when the improvement is $<10^{-100}$.

```{r ML_optim, cache = TRUE}
optim(c(0.1, 0.1), # Start at 0.1, 0.1
      log_lik,
      Y = undulation_rate,
      control = list(fnscale = -1,
                     reltol = 10^-100))
```

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

`glm()` fits generalized linear modules via optimization:

```{r ML_glm}
fm <- glm(undulation_rate ~ 1) # Estimate a mean only
coef(fm)
logLik(fm)
```

**For a small enough tolerance, the maximum likelihood estimate equals the analytical estimate.**

## Resampling inference of the mean

```{r}
set.seed(36428)
reps <- 100000
resampled_mean <- numeric(length = reps)

for (i in 1:reps) {
  resampled_mean[i] <- mean(sample(undulation_rate,
                                   replace = TRUE))
}
```

## Resampling inference of the mean

```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
data_frame(resampled_mean) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(resampled_mean)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(x = "Resampled Mean", y = "Count") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(resampled_mean), color = "red",
             size = 1.5)
```

## Resampling inference of the mean

```{r}
mean(undulation_rate)
mean(resampled_mean)
```

**Given enough iterations, the resampled mean equals the analytical mean (and equals the ML mean).**

## Bayesian vs. ML inference

Maximum likelihood inference:

- Probability of the data, given the parameter estimate
- Parameters are fixed; data varies.
- No prior possible

Bayesian inference:

- Probability of the parameters, given the data
- Data are fixed; parameters vary.
- Prior required

## Bayesian inference of the mean

Ranges of possible maximum likelihood values:

1. $\mu$: $-\infty < \mu < \infty$
2. $\sigma$: $0 < \sigma < \infty$

Drawbacks:

1. $\mu$ can't be negative (no negative undulation rates) and probably isn't a large number
2. $\sigma$ is also probably not huge either

Can we do better? Yes, Bayesian priors.

## Prior for the mean

```{r, ref.label="undulation_plot", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

## Prior for the mean

Cauchy distribution (location = 0, scale = 5)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_frame(
  x = seq(0, 10, length = 100),
  y = dcauchy(x, scale = 5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Relative Likelihood", x = "value")
```

## Bayesian model

[stan](http://mc-stan.org/) code:

```{r}
model <- "
  data{
    int<lower=1> N;
    real undulation_rate[N];
  }
  parameters{
    real<lower=0> mu;
    real<lower=0> sigma;
  }
  model{
    sigma ~ cauchy(0, 5);
    mu ~ cauchy(0, 5);
    undulation_rate ~ normal(mu, sigma);
  }
"
```

## Sample the Bayesian model

```{r stan_fit, cache=TRUE}
fm_priors <- stan(
  model_code = model,
  data = list(undulation_rate = undulation_rate,
              N = length(undulation_rate)),
  iter = 10^4,
  warmup = 10^3,
  seed = 12)
```

## Inspecting the samples

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
samp <- fm_priors@sim$samples
mu <- data_frame(Iteration = 1:length(samp[[1]]$mu),
                 Chain_1 = samp[[1]]$mu,
                 Chain_2 = samp[[2]]$mu,
                 Chain_3 = samp[[3]]$mu,
                 Chain_4 = samp[[4]]$mu)
mu %>% 
  gather(Chain, value, -Iteration) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Iteration, y = value, color = Chain)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlim(c(2000, 10000)) +
  labs(x = "Iteration", y = "mu")
```

## Summarizing the results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
post <- extract(fm_priors) %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  select(mu)
post %>%
  ggplot(aes(mu)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(x = TeX("$\\mu$"), y = "Density")
```

## Summarizing the results

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(fm_priors, digits = 3)
```

Lower mean than the analytical or ML estimate (`r round(mean(undulation_rate), 3)`) because the prior places more probability on lower values.
