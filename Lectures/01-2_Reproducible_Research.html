# Readings

Recommended:

- Buffalo (2015) Chapter 1: "How to Learn Bioinformatics"
    - Note: although the focus of this chapter is bioinformatics the rationale applies to any field of life sciences.

# What is reproducible research?

---

# Reproducible vs. replicable research

---

# Basic principles

1. Everything via scripts
1. Everything automated with documentation (e.g., comments)
1. Raw data is read only
1. All output reproducible

---

# Problems you are trying to avoid

---

# Point and click vs. scripting analyses

---

# Insulating data from analysis

---

# Basic tools for reproducible research

1. R
1. Markdown
1. Version control (git)

---

# Why R for reproducible research?

- Free, now and forever
- Comprehensive and flexible (perhaps too much so for beginners)
- Portable code (Windows, OS X, Unix-like)
- Publication quality plotting
- Encourages good data analysis practices
    - No point and click

---

# R will become essential for scientists (you, your students)

- As important as Word and Excel
- Learn it now while you have time and energy

---

# Why not some other statistics package or programming language?

- You probably won't have careers as biostatisticians (SAS, Stata)
- Won't tie to you some non-free software (SAS, SPSS, Systat, Stata, NCSS/PASS, MATLAB)
- Huge data (&gt;`\(10^6\)` observations) is rarely an issue (SAS, Stata, python, julia)
- Speed is rarely an issue for us (fortran, julia, MATLAB, python)
- Python (NumPy/SciPy/pandas/statsmodel) is less mature as a general statistical programming language

---

# R will make you angry

- Unforgiving
- Opaque
- Often inscrutable errors
    - Learning to deal with errors is critical to reproducibility

---

# R will make you happy

- Takes time

---

# Why no Powerpoint slides?

- Inefficient to make slides
- No mechanism to seamlessly include R output &amp; graphics
- Ugly equations
- Hard to keep track of changes
- Let something else handle formatting (R Markdown)
    - Nice HTML output
- Poor support for version control

---

# R `\(\neq\)` RStudio

- RStudio is an interface to R
- R can be run without RStudio.
    - The reverse is not true.
- RStudio is the most important thing to ever happen to R
- These slides were written using RStudio.

---

# R Markdown

- Text-based markup language (i.e., HTML)
- Variant of markdown (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- Render to different formats (PDF, HTML, docx)
- Inline R code
    - Your text and analysis coexist together in one file
