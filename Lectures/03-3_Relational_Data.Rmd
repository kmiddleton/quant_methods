## Relational Data

It is good practice to maintain smaller datasets and then merge them together through code. Using multiple tables of data is called *Relational Data* because we are interested in the relations between datasets, not individual ones.

Relations are always built between pairs of tables. And to do this work we need some terminology.

\bigskip

- **Mutating joins**: adds a new variable to one data frame from matching observations in another
- **Filtering joins**: filters observations from one data frame based on if they match an observation from another data frame.
- **Set operations**: treats observations as if they were set elements.
