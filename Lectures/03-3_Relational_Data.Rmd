## Relational Data

It is good practice to maintain smaller datasets and then merge them together through code. Using multiple tables of data is called *Relational Data* because we are interested in the relations between datasets, not individual ones.

Relations are always built between pairs of tables. And to do this work we need some terminology.

\bigskip

- **Mutating joins**: adds a new variable to one data frame from matching observations in another
- **Filtering joins**: filters observations from one data frame based on if they match an observation from another data frame.
- **Set operations**: treats observations as if they were set elements.

## Flight Data

We will use `library(nycflights13)`. This library contains data on flights in and out of NYC.


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
 
airlines  # describes all airlines in NYC

airports  # describes the airports flights go to/from

planes    # describes each plane

weather   # weather at each NYC airport each hour

```

- `flights` connects to `planes` via a single variable, `tailnum`.

- `flights` connects to `airlines` through the `carrier` variable.

- `flights` connects to `airports` in two ways: via the `origin` and `dest` variables.

- `flights` connects to `weather` via `origin` (the location), and `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).


</div>


## Keys

The terminology used by the tidyverse for a variable (or set of variables) that connects each pair of tables. There are three types of keys.

- *Primary Key* - uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. Here, `planes$tailnum` uniqely identifies each plane in the `planes` table.

<br />
</center>


## Keys  

- *Foreign Key* - uniquely identifies an observation in another table. Here, `flights$tailnum` appears in the `flights` table where it matches each flight to a unique plane in `planes`.

<center>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>
   


A *primary key* that corresponds to a *foreign key* is a relation.  



## Keys  

- *Surrogate Key* - sometimes datasets do not contain a primary key, so you must make one. 

    - `flights$tailnum` is not a primary key because the same plane appears multiple times per day at the airport. Create one using, for example, `mutate()` and `row_number()`. **This then becomes a *primary key*.**

## Mutating Joins {.smaller}

Mutating joins combine variables from two tables. 


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
              select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
```


## Mutating Joins {.smaller}

To add the full name of the airline to `flights2`, you combine `airlines` with `flights2` with `left_join()`.

\scriptsize
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```  
  
  

## Joins, How Do They Work? {.smaller}

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)

```

<br />

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
x
y

```
</div>


## Joins, How Do They Work? {.smaller}

Imagine you have two datasets, x (on the left) and y (on the right), and they each have *key* variables (colored column). The following diagram shows all potential matches with the grid lines

<center>

<br />
<br />
</center>   


However the only possible matches are indicated with colored dots. The resulting dataset demonstrates that in this case all variables are joined, and some observations are lost.

<br />
</center>   


## Inner Joins

Inner joins match pairs of observations based on equal key variables, but they lose observations without matches.
  
- You specify the key variable with `by`.

<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/EeOALSR.png" width="45%" />
<br />
</center>   

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

x %>% 
  inner_join(y, by = "key")

```


## Outer Joins

Outer joins also match observations based on key variables, but **do not** lose observations.

- There are three types of outer joins.

  1. A **left join** keeps all observations in `x`.
  1. A **right join** keeps all observations in `y`.
  1. A **full join** keeps all observations in `x` and `y`.
  
<br />
<br />
In all cases, unmatched observations are filled with `NA`.

## Left Join

<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/46Q3tL5.png" width="45%" />
<br />
</center>  
<br />

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

x %>% 
  left_join(y, by = "key")

```

## Right Join


<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/rC9NceI.png" width="45%" />
<br />
</center>  
<br />

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

x %>% 
  right_join(y, by = "key")

```


## Full Join

<center>

<br />
</center>  

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

x %>% 
  full_join(y, by = "key")

```


## Duplicate Keys {.smaller}

Sometimes keys are not unique. There are two possibilities.

- One table has duplicate keys (a 1:n relationship)

<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/7GjH2AH.png" width="45%" />
<br />
</center>  

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     1, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2"
)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```



## Duplicate Keys {.smaller}

- Both tables have duplicate keys. This is often an error because neither table has a unique identifier.


<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/ezFujKp.png" width="45%" />
<br />
</center>  


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     3, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     2, "y3",
     3, "y4"
)
```

\scriptsize
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```



## Defining Keys in Real Life {.smaller}

*Natural joins*, or `by = NULL` (the default) uses all variables that are in both tables. The `flights` and `weather` table have `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` in common.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}

flights2 %>%
  left_join(weather)

```


## Defining Keys in Real Life {.smaller}

You can join by a *character vector* with `by = "x"`. Try joining `flights` and `planes` by `tailnum`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}

flights2 %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")

```

You can see that both datasets had a `year` column but they had different values, so the resulting variables are `year.x` and `year.y`.



## Defining Keys in Real Life {.smaller}

A *named character vector*, for example `by = c("a" = "b")` allows you to match the same variables when they have different names in different tables (e.g. the `dest` column in `flights2` is the same as the `faa` column in `airports`).


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}

flights2 %>% 
  left_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa"))

```


## Filtering Joins

Filtering joins only affect observations, not variables.

- `semi_join(x, y)` **keeps** observations in `x` with a match in `y`.

<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/JXoDzXY.png" width="45%" />
<br />
</center>  



- `anti_join(x, y)` **drops** observations in `x` with a match in `y`.

<center>

<br />
</center>  


## `semi_join()` {.smaller}

So say you have a table of the top destinations (`top_dest`) and you want to know what flights go to those destinations.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}
trips <- flights %>%
          semi_join(top_dest)
trips[,1:7]
```


## `anti_join()` {.smaller}

Anti-joins are useful for figuring out mismatches. So say you want to know the `flights` that do not have a match in `planes`.

\scriptsize
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}
mismatch <- flights %>%
          anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
mismatch[,1:7]
```


## Set Operations {.smaller}

Set operations work with complete rows, and compare the values of every variable. For set operations, it is assumed that `x` and `y` have the same variables, and treat all observations as sets.

- `intersect(x, y)` returns only observations in both `x` and `y`.
- `union(x, y)` returns unique observations in `x` and `y`.
- `setdiff(x, y)` returns observations in `x`, but not `y`.




Say you have these datsets.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df1 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   2,  1
)
df2 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   1,  2
)
```

## Set Operations 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
intersect(df1, df2)

union(df1, df2)  #note we get 3 rows, not 4.

```
## Set Operations

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
setdiff(df1, df2)

setdiff(df2, df1)
```
