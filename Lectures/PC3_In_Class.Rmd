## PCA


## Life history in mammals

Hamel, S., J.-M. Gaillard, M. Festa-Bianchet, and S. D. Côté. 2009. Individual quality, early-life conditions, and reproductive success in contrasted populations of large herbivores. Ecology 90:1981–1995.

> Variations among individuals in phenotypic quality and fitness often confound analyses of life-history strategies assessed at the population level. We used detailed long-term data from three populations of large herbivores ... to quantify heterogeneity in individual quality among females, and to assess its influence on mean annual reproductive success over the lifetime (MRS). ... Using multivariate analyses (PCA), we identified ... covariations among life-history traits (longevity, success in the last breeding opportunity, adult mass, and social rank) as indexes of individual quality that positively influenced MRS of females. Individual quality was reduced by unfavorable weather, low resource availability, and high population density in the year of birth. ...

## Life history in mammals

> For mountain goats, the two first PCs were retained (consecutive eigenvalues [% variation explained]: PC1: 2.4 [29.8%], PC2: 2.0 [24.7%], PC3: 1.2 [15.1%], PC4: 0.9 [11.4%], PC5: 0.6 [7.9%], PC6: 0.5 [5.6%], PC7: 0.4 [5.2%], PC8: 0.01 [0.1%]) and accounted for 54% of the variation observed among life-history traits at the individual level


## Life history in mammals

> PC1 corresponded to a quality index opposing heavy and dominant individuals to light and subordinate ones (thereafter called "mass–social rank scores"; eigenvectors: social rank = 0.49, adult mass = 0.39, offspring sex ratio = -0.15, AFR = -0.20, molt date = - 0.33, ALR = -0.36, longevity = -0.39, parturition date = -0.41

## Predictors of flight and foraging in birds

Bribiesca-Contreras, F., B. Parslew, and W. I. Sellers. 2021. Functional morphology of the forelimb musculature reflects flight and foraging styles in aquatic birds. *J. Ornithol*. 162:779–793.

> Aquatic birds show a great diversity of locomotion styles and wing morphologies, from penguins that are fully specialized for an aquatic life to species of aerial flyers that also use their wings for underwater propulsion ... we investigated the functional morphology of the forelimb musculature of 18 species of aquatic birds that display a variety of flight and foraging styles. ... A principal component analysis (PCA) of normalised muscle masses resulted in a biplot where three main morphological groups can be distinguished. Anatids (ducks and geese) occupy a space represented by muscles that are activated during downstroke. Auks and penguins clustered together in a region dominated by muscles that assist in wing elevation and showed a degree of hypertrophy. The rest of the species grouped together in the lower limits of both PCs ...

> PCA resulted in three principal components (PC1–PC3)  that explained 74.56% of the total variance of muscle mass along the wing. PC1 mostly separated the anatids  (Ab, Ap, As) from penguins (Em, Sd, Sh) in opposite extremes and the rest of the species in the middle.

## False negatives & False positives

> I feel like determining effect size beforehand is kind of arbitrary, especially if you were in a situation where not a lot of previous studies had been done on something, and you are unsure of what kind of effect size would be meaningful. Are there any guidelines for how to handle a situation like that?

> Could you please review the relationship between alpha levels and power? I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out how to increase power for a given alpha level.

> Can we go over type I and type II errors again? I still don't fully understand them and how they inform the tests we do.


## False negatives & False positives

> I would like to go over power analysis one more time--I think another example might help it click better for me.

> Can we review the differences between FWER, FDR, and pFDR.

> I was/am confused on the last question of the key for PS-11 where it asks to "Calculate the FWER corresponding to an alpha of 5% by calculating the lowest P-value for each iteration. Then, use the `quantile()` function to calculate the 5% quantile." - why isn't it: "1-(quantile(minP, 0.05))"? When I look at the graph of FWER against alpha thresholds, it looks like the FWER is very close to 1 at an alpha of 0.05? I feel like I'm misinterpreting the concept and/or the question.

>I will be doing protein analysis in the near future, and I would like to know more about FDR. If possible, please go over this topic again


## Linear models

> How do you determine non-independence between variables? How does determining this lead to choosing Type II or Type III sums of squares?

> For the guppy simulation in the problem set, how is it showing pseudoreplication? Is it because the two sets of three rivers are not all independent?

> Can we talk about how incorporating multiple measurements at varying time points affects stats and to what degree we need to account for this?

> Could you review the differences between lm(), lme(), aov(), etc?

> I would appreciated if you talk about nested models, and the interpretation of PCA.

> How to read the summaries of all of the independence tests.


## PS 12

> I don't understand the output of the last chunk on PS12. What does getting the 10,000 F statistics mean, again?

> I would like to go over Problem Set 12 because I am not sure what exactly we were trying to do.


## Simulations

> When we are pulling and plotting p-values in the simulated data set (around line 100ish of the PC_03) are we pulling the p-value associated with "intercept", "low/high" (depending on factor level), or both intercept and low/high. I pulled all p-values in to a 4 column tibble, and have 4 plots total for that section and I want to make sure I am on the right track and interpreting this correctly.

> for loops (again) & setting up data. frames to store objects as a for loop is executing.

> Can you explain in what scenarios we want to create a simulation? I know we do it a lot here to demonstrate how certain theories are true, but when would you use them while doing research?


## Pipelines & Guides

> Is there a cheat sheet or a checklist to go through to deduce which statistical test to use in which situation?

> Depending data nature we can use multiple tools we covered. It would be great if you can put together one example from data acquisition to analysis (the whole process) in one template; I meant sort of pipeline that we just change file name and analyze the whole data in one go.
