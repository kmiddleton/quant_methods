## Life history in mammals

Hamel, S., J.-M. Gaillard, M. Festa-Bianchet, and S. D. Côté. 2009. Individual quality, early-life conditions, and reproductive success in contrasted populations of large herbivores. Ecology 90:1981–1995.

> Variations among individuals in phenotypic quality and fitness often confound analyses of life-history strategies assessed at the population level. We used detailed long-term data from three populations of large herbivores ... to quantify heterogeneity in individual quality among females, and to assess its influence on mean annual reproductive success over the lifetime (MRS). ... Using multivariate analyses (PCA), we identified ... covariations among life-history traits (longevity, success in the last breeding opportunity, adult mass, and social rank) as indexes of individual quality that positively influenced MRS of females. Individual quality was reduced by unfavorable weather, low resource availability, and high population density in the year of birth. ...

## Life history in mammals

> For mountain goats, the two first PCs were retained (consecutive eigenvalues [% variation explained]: PC1: 2.4 [29.8%], PC2: 2.0 [24.7%], PC3: 1.2 [15.1%], PC4: 0.9 [11.4%], PC5: 0.6 [7.9%], PC6: 0.5 [5.6%], PC7: 0.4 [5.2%], PC8: 0.01 [0.1%]) and accounted for 54% of the variation observed among life-history traits at the individual level


## Life history in mammals

> PC1 corresponded to a quality index opposing heavy and dominant individuals to light and subordinate ones (thereafter called "mass–social rank scores"; eigenvectors: social rank = 0.49, adult mass = 0.39, offspring sex ratio = -0.15, AFR = -0.20, molt date = - 0.33, ALR = -0.36, longevity = -0.39, parturition date = -0.41

## Predictors of flight and foraging in birds

Bribiesca-Contreras, F., B. Parslew, and W. I. Sellers. 2021. Functional morphology of the forelimb musculature reflects flight and foraging styles in aquatic birds. *J. Ornithol*. 162:779–793.

> Aquatic birds show a great diversity of locomotion styles and wing morphologies, from penguins that are fully specialized for an aquatic life to species of aerial flyers that also use their wings for underwater propulsion ... we investigated the functional morphology of the forelimb musculature of 18 species of aquatic birds that display a variety of flight and foraging styles. ... A principal component analysis (PCA) of normalised muscle masses resulted in a biplot where three main morphological groups can be distinguished. Anatids (ducks and geese) occupy a space represented by muscles that are activated during downstroke. Auks and penguins clustered together in a region dominated by muscles that assist in wing elevation and showed a degree of hypertrophy. The rest of the species grouped together in the lower limits of both PCs ...

> PCA resulted in three principal components (PC1–PC3)  that explained 74.56% of the total variance of muscle mass along the wing. PC1 mostly separated the anatids  (Ab, Ap, As) from penguins (Em, Sd, Sh) in opposite extremes and the rest of the species in the middle.

## Decision Errors

> Multiple testing, what's the significance of performing FWER and FDR?

## Linear models

> Can we talk about how incorporating multiple measurements at varying time points affects stats and to what degree we need to account for this?

> Could you review the differences between lm(), lme(), aov(), anova(), Anova() etc?

> what is the difference between "random = ~ 1 | ID " and "random = ~ ID" in lme function

## PC03 River Question

> In PC03, the first activity fitting a linear model that ignores river id (This is pseudoreplication) and a mixed model using `lme()` with river id as a random effect (The correct model): I am getting same p-value with both models. I think the error might be because of the River_ID. I created this column with "ID = seq(1, 60)".

> I still struggle a little with the questions where we simulate data. In the first question, I am not sure how making a table with river ID would work. Should we just randomly assign rivers 1-3?

## Cross-Validation & Model Comparison

> Reviewing the benefits and drawbacks of different cross-validation techniques as well as a brief review of how to interpret their results what to focus on in the output

> I would like to go over model comparison and some of the functions in R because I found that unit the most useful.

## Simulations & Loops

> More practice setting up loops

> Can you explain in what scenarios we want to create a simulation? I know we do it a lot here to demonstrate how certain theories are true, but when would you use them while doing research?


## Guides 

> Is there a cheat sheet or a checklist to go through to deduce which statistical test to use in which situation?
