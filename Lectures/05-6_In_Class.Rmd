## Installing packages

> It is best to install packages (e.g., `install.packages("cowplot")`) from the command line only. If you include this code in a R code chunk, you risk R trying to reinstall the package each time you knit your file.


## Priors

> When discussing prior knowledge related to Bayesian methods; is that the same as things like genomic selection where a Genomic Breeding Value is assigned based on training data sets to inform a model on how to handle the experimental data sets?


## `read_excel()`

> When I try to knit my code it does not want to complete a read_excel() command? Is this something I need to update? I worked around by making the excel file a .csv for now.

## Frameworks

> Is there any instance where you would use both Maximum Likelihood and bayesian inference with a data set? Could one method be used to validate an answer you got from the other?


## Themes

- Loops and functions
    - This unit's problem set
- What is likelihood and what does it mean?
- Likelihood vs. *relative* likelihood vs. probability
    - https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/156937/597
- Grid approximation vs. optimization
- How Bayesian methods work "under the hood"
    - More coming soon
    - Bayes rule

$$P[\Theta | Data] = \frac{P[Data | \Theta] \times P[\Theta]}{P[Data]}$$


## Themes

- Big picture of analytical vs. ML vs. resampling vs. Bayesian
    - What do we want you to understand about them?
    - More practical examples
    - When to use each
    - Does needing to use one imply bad design?
