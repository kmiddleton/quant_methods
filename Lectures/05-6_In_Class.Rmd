## Themes

- Topics that are coming up. We have a plan.
- Need practice coding, lectures not as good for learning coding
- Few quick questions
- Big picture of analytical vs. ML vs. resampling vs. Bayesian


## Progress Check 1

- Look at the key
- Questions next week


## Installing packages

> It is best to install packages (e.g., `install.packages("cowplot")`) from the command line only. If you include this code in a R code chunk, you risk R trying to reinstall the package each time you knit your file.


## `read_excel()`

> When I try to knit my code it does not want to complete a read_excel() command? Is this something I need to update? I worked around by making the excel file a .csv for now.


## Analytical Frameworks

- What do we want you to understand about them?
- When to use each
- Does needing to use one imply bad design?
- More practical examples


## To breakout rooms


## Frameworks

> Is there any instance where you would use both Maximum Likelihood and bayesian inference with a data set? Could one method be used to validate an answer you got from the other?

> If you have a small dataset would maximum likelihood be preferred over Bayesian inference?

> Are there instances where using a Baysian vs ML approaches give you different answers? And if so what parameters are causing these differences? 

## Bayesian inference

> With Bayesian, How far do you go to get your model to match your data? Is overfitting a problem here?

> Are there guidelines for how to pick a distribution to represent your means?  For example, you picked Cauchy, but what made you pick that? (To be fair, I don't really know all the different distributions)


## Priors

> For priors, do you just make an educated guess based on your data on how to frame things, or is there a more systematic way of doing it?

> When discussing prior knowledge related to Bayesian methods; is that the same as things like genomic selection where a Genomic Breeding Value is assigned based on training data sets to inform a model on how to handle the experimental data sets?


## Binomial sample sizes

> One of my main questions has to do with connecting the results of the Maximum Likelihood method with its equation as sample size increases.  My confusion is - where is the sample size increasing at if, for the coin flip example, n = 1 for 2H/6flips, 20/60, and for 20000/60000.  Is 2H/6flips 1 observation or 6, and so on for 20/60 and 20000/60000?  (a separate email has more details).

> How do you even get there? How do you meaningfully compare maximum likelihoods from datasets that have different numbers of observations (say X short winged insects but Y long-winged insects)?
