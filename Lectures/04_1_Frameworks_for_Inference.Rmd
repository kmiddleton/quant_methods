## Notes

## Readings

## Remember the Goal of Statistics

> "a way of taming **uncertainty**, of turning raw **data** into arguments that can resolve profound questions" [@amabile_all_1989]


- Success depends on evaluating the relative support for different models

## Models?

## Example: Wing Dimorphic Crickets

> Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?

<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<img src="images/GFIRMUS2.jpg" width="100%" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>

Controlling for body mass,

- Metabolic rates do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average  metabolic rate of long-wings is lower

</div>

## Example: Genetics of Corn Oil Content

> Which set of loci best predicts oil content in corn kernels?

<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<br />
<img src="images/corn_oil.jpg" width="100%" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>

- Heritability of corn oil content is 0
- Different possible combinations of SNPs
- All additive
- Dominance
- Epistasis
- Structural variants

</div>

## Example: Canid relationships

> What are the phylogenetic relationships between dog breeds & other canids?

<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<img src="images/Dog_Tree.png" width="100%" />
<br />
<br />

</center>



- Star phylogeny
- Single origin of dogs
- Ancient breeds are monophyletic
- Every possible tree....

## Example: Template

> Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?

<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<img src="images/GFIRMUS2.jpg" width="100%" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>

Controlling for body mass,

- Metabolic rates do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average  metabolic rate of long-wings is lower
