## Horned lizard predation

```{r message=FALSE}
HL <- read_csv("../data/HornedLizards.csv")
glimpse(HL)
HL %>% group_by(group) %>% tally()
```

## Horned lizard predation

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
HL %>% 
  ggplot(aes(horn_length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  facet_grid(group ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Horn Length (mm)", y = "Count")
```

## Summarize

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
HL %>% group_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(horn_mean = mean(horn_length),
            horn_sd = sd(horn_length))
sum(!complete.cases(HL))
```

## Summarize

Drop rows with any `NA`s:

```{r}
HL <- HL %>% drop_na()
```

Summarize:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
HL %>% group_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(horn_mean = mean(horn_length),
            horn_sd = sd(horn_length))
```

## Are the means different?

Horn length in live horned lizards: `r round(mean(HL$horn_length[HL$group == "alive"]), 2)` mm

Horn length in dead horned lizards: `r round(mean(HL$horn_length[HL$group == "dead"]), 2)` mm

Imagine you collected 100 live horned lizards and randomly assigned 50 to each of two groups. Do you think they would have the same mean horn length? How different do you think the means would be? Think about how the variability among individual horn length measurements would affect your intuition here.

## How large of a difference do we expect to see from sampling error?

- Imagine a distribution of horn lengths for a population of horned lizards (mean = 24, sd = 3)
- Randomly catch two groups of $n = 50$ from this population
- How different are the groups?

## How large of a difference do we expect to see from sampling error?

```{r}

mu.horn <- 24   # mean
sd.horn <- 3    # standard deviation
n.iter <- 10000 # number of iterations
n.samp <- 50    # number in each sample
sim.diff <- tibble(dd = numeric(length = n.iter)) # to hold for output  

for (zz in 1:n.iter) {
  s1 <- rnorm(n.samp, mu.horn, sd.horn) # sample 1
  s2 <- rnorm(n.samp, mu.horn, sd.horn) # sample 2
  sim.diff[zz, 'dd'] <- mean(s1) - mean(s2) # difference in means
}

## Frameworks for inference

1. Analytical
2. Maximum likelihood
3. Resampling
4. Bayesian

## Analytical: *t*-test

```{r t_plot, message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- seq(-3, 3, by = 0.001)

sim <- tibble(df = c(2, 10, 50)) %>%
  group_by(df) %>%
  do(tibble(x = x, y = dt(x, .$df))) %>%
  mutate(Parameters = paste0("df = ", df)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Parameters = factor(Parameters, levels = unique(Parameters)))

norm <- tibble(
  x = x,
  y = dnorm(x, 0, 1)
)

pal <- wes_palette("Moonrise3", 3, type = "discrete")

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = sim, aes(x, y, color = Parameters), size = 1.5) +
  geom_line(data = norm, aes(x, y)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = pal, name = "Degrees of\nFreedom") +
  labs(x = "x", y = "Relative Likelihood") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.75))
```

- Test statistic based on means, standard deviations, and sample size 
- Follows a *t* distribution
- Like a normal distribution that accounts for sample size
- We won't derive the *t* distribution

</div>

## *t*-test

```{r}
t.test(horn_length ~ group, data = HL, var.equal = TRUE)
```
