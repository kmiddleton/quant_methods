## Measures of central tendency (location)

The value around which the distribution is centered

1. Mean 
1. Median
1. Mode (most common value)

## Mean

Sample (arithmetic) mean:

$$\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}Y_i}{n}$$

The term "mean" is preferred to "average". The arithmetic mean is one kind of average, but there are others (as there are other types of means).

- One argument: "Average" is a statistic determined by an arithmetic procedure. "Mean" is a parameter.

## Median

The median is the central measurement of a sample (the 50th percentile and the 0.50 quantile). If $n$ is even, then the median is the mean of the two middle observations.

```{r}
1:10
median(1:10)
quantile(1:10, prob = 0.5)
```

## Mean vs. Median

Number of lateral plates (plates) in threespine sticklebacks (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) with three different *Ectodysplasin* genotypes (mm, Mm, and MM).

## Mean vs. Median

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
SticklebackPlates <- read_csv("../data/Stickleback_Plates.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(SticklebackPlates)
```

## Mean vs. Median

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = plates)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  xlab("Number of Lateral Body Plates") +
  ylab("Count")
```

## Mean vs. Median

```{r}
SticklebackPlates %>% group_by(genotype) %>% 
  summarize(mean_plate = mean(plates),
            median_plate = median(plates),
            .groups = "drop")
```

## Mean is sensitive to extreme values

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
M <- SticklebackPlates %>% 
  group_by(genotype) %>% 
  summarize(Mean = mean(plates),
            Median = median(plates),
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  gather(Value, x, -genotype)

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = plates, group = genotype)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  geom_vline(data = M, aes(xintercept = x, color = Value),
             size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  xlab("Number of Lateral Body Plates") +
  ylab("Count")
```

## When might you substitute the median for the mean? | (As a measure of central tendency)

## Why don't we always use the median?

## Frameworks for inference

## Inferring a mean

Mean undulation rate for $n = 8$ [gliding snakes](http://www.flyingsnake.org/):

```{r}
undulation_rate <- c(0.9, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.6, 2.0)
```

<center>
<img src="http://www.lazerhorse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Flying-Snake-Chrysopelea.jpg" width="60%" />
</center>

What is the mean undulation rate for this sample of flying snakes?

## Undulation rate

```{r undulation_plot, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tibble(undulation_rate), aes(undulation_rate)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Undulation Rate (Hz)", y = "Count")
```

## Analytical inference of mean

Arithmetic mean:

$$\hat{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}{n}$$

$$mean~undulation~rate = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}undulation~rate_i}{n}$$

## Analytical inference of mean

```{r}
sum(undulation_rate) / length(undulation_rate)
mean(undulation_rate)
```

## Maximum likelihood inference of mean

Use `dnorm()` to calculate the relative likelihood of an observed value $Y_i$ drawn from a normal distribution given a mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$).

$$f\left(Y_i; \mu, \sigma\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}} e^{\frac{-\left(Y_i-\mu\right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}$$

## Standard normal distribution

```{r}
dnorm(0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

```{r normal_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
M <- tibble(x = seq(-3, 3, length = 100),
            y = dnorm(x))
ggplot(M, aes(x, y)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Y", y = "Relative Likelihood")
```

## Calculating a likelihood

*Hypothesizing that the population mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1*, what is the likelihood of the observed values?

1. This is a model.
2. Calculate the relative likelihood of each observation
3. Model likelihood is the product of the individual likelihoods
4. log-likelihood is more tractable, so calculate that

## Model Likelihood ($\mathcal{L}$)

For a set of observations ($Y_i$) and hypothesized parameters ($\Theta$; i.e., mean and standard deviation) the model likelihood is the product of the observations' individual likelihoods:

$$\mathcal{L}\left(\left\{ Y_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{n};\Theta\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\phi\left(Y_{i}; \Theta\right)$$

$$\log\left(\mathcal{L}\left(\left\{ Y_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{n};\Theta\right)\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log\left(\phi\left(Y_{i};\Theta\right)\right)$$

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

*Hypothesizing that the population mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1*, what is the likelihood of the observed values?

Likelihood for the first observation (`undulation_rate[1]`):

```{r}
undulation_rate[1]
dnorm(undulation_rate[1], mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(M, aes(x, y)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Y", y = "Relative Likelihood") +
  geom_point(aes(x = undulation_rate[1],
                 y = dnorm(undulation_rate[1], mean = 0, sd = 1)),
             color = "red",
             size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = undulation_rate[1],
                   xend = undulation_rate[1],
                   y = 0,
                   yend = dnorm(undulation_rate[1],
                                mean = 0, sd = 1)),
               color = "red")
```

This is only the likelihood for *one* observation. We need the likelihoods for all `r length(undulation_rate)` undulation rates to get a model likelihood.

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

Vector of likelihoods for all values in `undulation_rate` given `mu = 0` and `sigma = 1`:

```{r}
(rel_liks <- dnorm(undulation_rate, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a single combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

Model likelihood is the product of those likelihoods:

```{r}
(lik <- prod(rel_liks))
```

## Likelihood to log-likelihood

```{r}
log(lik)
```

Rather than logging the product, we can sum the log-likelihoods:

```{r}
sum(log(rel_liks))
```

For a model in which the mean is 0 and  standard deviation is 1, the model log-likelihood is `r round(log(lik), 2)`.

## Higher likelihood

Is there another combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that gives a higher likelihood (= larger log-likelihood)?

Try $\mu = 1$ and $\sigma = 1$:

```{r}
sum(log(dnorm(undulation_rate, mean = 1, sd = 1)))
```

This is an improvement over $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.

## Calculating the log-likelihood for a _range_ of $\mu$ and $\sigma$

Find the combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that maximizes the log-likelihood of the model for the mean and standard deviation of undulation rates.

Ranges of possible values:

1. Mean ($\mu$): $-\infty < \mu < \infty$
2. Standard deviation ($\sigma$): $0 < \sigma < \infty$

## Grid approximation

For combinations of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, calculate the model likelihood. Pick the largest log-likelihood as the parameter estimates.

Set up the grid:

```{r}
n <- 100                           # How fine is the grid?
mu <- seq(0.1, 3, length = n)      # Vector of mu
sigma <- seq(0.1, 0.5, length = n) # Vector of sigma

grid_approx <- crossing(mu, sigma)
```

---

```{r}
grid_approx
```

## Grid approximation

```{r grid_approx, cache=TRUE}
log_lik <- numeric(length = nrow(grid_approx))

for (ii in 1:nrow(grid_approx)) {
  log_lik[ii] <- 
    sum(dnorm(undulation_rate,
              mean = grid_approx$mu[ii],
              sd = grid_approx$sigma[ii],
              log = TRUE))
}
grid_approx$log_lik <- log_lik
```

- Iterate through the rows ($ii$) of `grid_approx`
- For each row, assign the model log-likelihood calculated for that `mu` and `sigma` to `log_lik`

---

```{r}
grid_approx
```

- For a 100 X 100 grid, there are 10,000 calculations.
- If there were 3 parameters, there would be 1,000,000.

## Visualizing the likelihood surface

```{r echo=FALSE}
grid_approx <- do.call(data.frame,
                       lapply(grid_approx,
                              function(x) replace(x, is.infinite(x), NA)))

fig <- plot_ly() %>%
  add_markers(data = grid_approx,
              x = ~ mu,
              y = ~ sigma,
              z = ~ log_lik,
              color = ~ log_lik,
              size = 1,
              showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  add_markers(data = grid_approx[which.max(grid_approx$log_lik), ],
              x = ~ mu,
              y = ~ sigma,
              z = ~ log_lik,
              size = 2,
              showlegend = FALSE) %>% 
  hide_colorbar() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Mu'),
                      yaxis = list(title = 'Sigma'),
                      zaxis = list(title = 'log-Likelihood')))

fig
```


## Grid approximation

On this grid, the maximum likelihood estimates of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are:

```{r}
grid_approx[which.max(grid_approx$log_lik), ]
```

The analytical estimates are:

```{r}
mean(undulation_rate)
sd(undulation_rate)
```

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

*Search* for the most likely values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ across all possible values.

```{r echo=FALSE}
fig
```

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

Define a function that takes a vector of values to optimize `x` ($\mu$ and $\sigma$) as well as a set of data `Y` and returns the log-likelihood:

```{r}
log_lik <- function(x, Y){
  liks <- dnorm(Y, mean = x[1], sd = x[2], log = TRUE)
  return(sum(liks))
}
```

We can now simultaneously optimize $\mu$ and $\sigma$, maximizing the log-likelihood.

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

`reltol` says to stop when the improvement is $<10^{-100}$.

```{r ML_optim, cache = TRUE}
optim(c(0.1, 0.1), # Start at 0.1, 0.1
      log_lik,
      Y = undulation_rate,
      control = list(fnscale = -1,
                     reltol = 10^-100))
```

## Maximum likelihood via optimization

`glm()` fits generalized linear modules via optimization:

```{r ML_glm}
fm <- glm(undulation_rate ~ 1) # Estimate a mean only
coef(fm)
logLik(fm)
```

**For a small enough tolerance, the maximum likelihood estimate equals the analytical estimate.**
