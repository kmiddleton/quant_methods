## Uncertainty & Science

> Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty—some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain (Feynman)

Probability is a way to quantify uncertainty.

## Why learn probability?

Basis of logical deduction

- Should you fly or drive?
- Should you not eat raw cookie dough?

Basis of inference systems

- Likelihood and Bayesian

Basis of P-values

- Cornerstone of null hypothesis testing

## Basics of probability

The probability of an event is the proportion of times the event would occur if a random trial is repeated infinitely under constant conditions.

## Basics of probability

The probability of an event is the **proportion** of times the event **would** occur **if** a **random** trial is repeated **infinitely** under **constant conditions**.

- proportion
- would occur
- if
- random trial
- infinitely
- constant conditions

## Basics of probability

The probability of an event is the **proportion** of times the event **would** occur **if** a **random** trial is repeated **infinitely** under **constant conditions**.

## Basics of probability

Probabilities are proportions.

Pr[event] is the abbreviation for “the probability of
event A occurring.”

- $Pr[heads] = 0.50$: Heads
- $Pr[heads'] = 0.50$: *Not* heads

The range of probabilities for an event is 0 $\rightarrow$ 1
(including 0 and 1).

## Addition rule | Mutually exclusive events

*Mutually exclusive* events are events that are not simultaneously possible due to constraints of physics, biology, development, evolution, etc.

- $Pr[A~and~B] = Pr[A, B] = 0$
- Probability of A and B occurring simultaneously.
- e.g., You can't flip a coin heads and tails in one trial
    - $Pr[H, T] = 0$
- $Pr[A~or~B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B]$

## Addition rule | Mutually exclusive events

On a single dice roll, what is the probability of rolling *either* a 1 *or* a 2?

On a single dice roll, what is the probability of rolling *either* a 1, a 2, *or* a 3?


## Multiplication rule | Independent events

If events are *independent*, then their individual probabilities do not influence each other. 

- The occurrence of one does not alter the probability of the other.
- Successive coin flips
- Successive dice rolls
- Successive roulette wheel spins
- Weekly lottery drawings
- Child sex (in the absence of bad genes)

## Multiplication rule | Independent events

$$Pr[A, B] = Pr[A] \times Pr[B]$$
In two successive dice rolls, what is the probability of rolling  a 1 *followed by* a 2?

In three successive dice rolls, what is the probability of rolling  a 1 *followed by* a 2, *followed by* a 6?


## Multiplication rule | Independent events

$$Pr[A, B] = Pr[A] \times Pr[B]$$

## Binomial probabilities

KM's sister has 4 children of which 4 are girls. 

What is the probability of having 4 children that are all girls if $Pr[girl]=0.488$?

## Binomial probabilities

```{r}
0.488 ^ 4
dbinom(4, 4, 0.488)
```

Imagine KM's sister really wants a boy. What is the probability her next child will be a boy?

## Binomial Distribution

- Probability distributions are basically like counting the ways things can happen
- In R, you can "flip a coin" using the binomial distribution. The function is `rbinom()`. Try one flip: `rbinom(1,1,0.5)`

## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin once, possible outcomes are H or T. How many ways are there to get one H? One T?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}

flip1 <- tibble(
 Ways = c(1, 1),
 Flips = c("1 Head", "1 Tail")
)

flip1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```

## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin twice, what are the possible outcomes?

1. HH
1. HT, TH
1. TT

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.height=3}

flip2 <- tibble(
 Ways = c(1, 2, 1),
 Flips = c("2 Head", "1 Head, 1 Tail", "2 Tail")) %>% 
 mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```

## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin 3 times, what are the possible outcomes?

1. HHH
1. HHT, HTH, THH
1. TTH, THT, HTT
1. TTT

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}

flip3 <- tibble(
 Ways = c(1, 3, 3, 1),
 Flips = c("3 Head", "2 Head, 1 Tail", "1 Head, 2 Tail",
           "3 Tail")) %>% 
 mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip3 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```

## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin 4 times, what are the possible outcomes?

1. HHH
1. HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, THHH
1. HHTT, TTHH, HTHT, THTH, HTTH, THHT
1. TTTH, TTHT, THTT, HTTT
1. TTTT

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}

flip4 <- tibble(
 Ways = c(1, 4, 6, 4, 1),
 Flips = c("4 Head", "3 Head, 1 Tail", "2 Head, 2 Tail",
           "1 Head, 3 Tail", "4 Tail")) %>% 
 mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip4 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "Identity")
```

## Binomial Distribution

If we flip a coin 6 times, what are the possible outcomes?


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}

flip6 <- tibble(
 Ways = c(1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1),
 Flips = c("6 H", "5 H, 1 T", "4 H, 2 T",
           "3 H, 3 T", "2 H, 4 T", 
           "1 H, 5 T", "6 T")) %>% 
 mutate(Flips = fct_inorder(Flips))

flip6 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Flips, y = Ways)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "Identity")

```
