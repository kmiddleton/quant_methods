## Measurement

1. Accuracy & Precision

  - they could make each situation using rnorm?
  
## Samples vs. populations

What are your populations of interest?

What are your samples?

How representative are your samples?

## Independent and identically distributed (IID)

- All observations are independent of one another
- All observations come from the same underlying probability distribution (normal, binomial, etc.)

Standard assumption of most statistical tests.

## Thinking about probabilities

Why learn probability?

- You could learn all the statistical analyses/tests without really understanding probability.

## Should the Packers have gone for 2? | 2015 NFL playoffs

Packers score on a hail mary touchdown to trail by 1 point at the end of the game.

## Should the Packers have gone for 2?

Two-point conversion + win:

- League-wide success rate (since 2003): 431 of 913

Extra point + overtime:

- Extra point success rate (2015 only; after the extra point attempt was moved back): 1,131 of 1,199
- Expected winning percentage in overtime (since 2001): Away team has won 110 of 242 games

## Should the Packers have gone for 2?

```{r}
# 2-pt conversion
431/913
```

```{r}
# Extra point + overtime
(1131 / 1199) * (110 / 242)
```

```{r}
# Odds
(431/913) / ((1131 / 1199) * (110 / 242))
```

## Binomial probabilities

About 10% of people are left handed.

- What is the probability of exactly 0 left handed person in a *random sample* of 25?
- What is the probability of exactly 1?
- What is the probability of 1 *or more*?

## Binomial probabilities

Probability density functions in R: `dbinom()`, `dnorm()`, `dpois()`, etc.

`dbinom(x, size, prob)`

- `x` = Number of "successes"
- `size` = Sample size
- `prob` = Probability of success for each trial

## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 0 left handed people in a *sample* of 25?

```{r eval=FALSE}
dbinom(0, 25, prob = 0.1)
```

## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 0 left handed people in a *sample* of 25?

```{r}
dbinom(0, 25, prob = 0.1)
```

## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of exactly 1?

## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of exactly 1?

```{r}
dbinom(1, 25, prob = 0.1)
```

## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 1 *or more*?

## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 1 *or more*?

```{r}
sum(dbinom(1:25, 25, prob = 0.1))
```

*"or more"* is critical here for hypothesis testing:

- Probability of the observed data or any *more extreme*

## Binomial probabilities for Pr[left] = 0.1

```{r echo=FALSE}
M <- data_frame(Lefties = 0:25,
                Probability = dbinom(0:25, 25, prob = 0.1))
ggplot(M, aes(Lefties, Probability)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "n Left-handers") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 25, by = 5))
```

$n > 8$ have very low probabilities.

## Binomial probabilities for Pr[left] = 0.1

```{r echo=FALSE}
M <- data_frame(Lefties = 0:25,
                Probability = dbinom(0:25, 25, prob = 0.1)) %>% 
  mutate(log_Prob = log10(Probability))
ggplot(M, aes(Lefties, log_Prob)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "n Left-handers", y = "log10 Probability") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 25, by = 5))
```

## Powerball

1. 69 balls in one pool: Choose 5
1. 26 in the other pool: Choose 1

Number of winning combinations in pool 1 is the **binomial coefficient**

- the number of unique ordered sequences of successes that yield exactly $k$ successes from $n$ trials ("n choose k").
- the "successes" can happen in any order
- `choose(n, k)`

$$\left({n\atop k}\right)=\frac{n!}{k!\left(n - k\right)!}$$

## Powerball

1. 69 balls in one pool: Choose 5
1. 26 in the other pool: Choose 1

```{r}
choose(69, 5)
choose(26, 1)
```

## Powerball

5 successes from 69 chances $\times$ 1 success from 26 chances.

```{r}
choose(69, 5) * choose(26, 1)
```

What if the order had to be correct as well?

## Odds of one or more winners

Imagine that 500000 *unique* tickets are sold. What is the probability of 1 or more winners?

## Odds of one or more winners

Imagine that 500000 *unique* tickets are sold. What is the probability of 1 or more winners?

```{r}
n <- 500000
p_win <- 1 / choose(69, 5) * choose(26, 1)
sum(dbinom(1:n, n, p_win))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

```


## Conditional probability thought experiment

A coin is tossed 100 times. Gamblers can bet on the total number of heads that will be thrown. They can do so at any time before or during the game.

- Imagine that you're betting before the game starts. What is your best bet?

## Conditional probability thought experiment

Now imagine that you're betting after the coin was already tossed 10 times and came up heads all 10 times.

- What is the best bet now?

## Breast cancer screening

Approximately correct numbers:

1. 1 in 100 women in the age range 40-50 have breast cancer
2. 80% with cancer have a positive mammogram (true positives)
3. 10% without cancer have a positive mammogram (false positives)

What is the probability of a randomly sampled woman having breast cancer, given a positive test?

## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|T] = \frac{Pr[T|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[T]}$$

- $Pr[T|C] = 0.8$
- $Pr[C] = 1/100 = 0.01$
- $Pr[T]$ = ???

## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|T] = \frac{Pr[T|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[T]}$$

- $Pr[T|C] = 0.8$
- $Pr[C] = 1/100 = 0.01$
- $Pr[T] = (0.8 \times 0.01) + (0.1 \times 0.99)$

## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|T] = \frac{Pr[T|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[T]}$$

- $Pr[T|C] = 0.8$
- $Pr[C] = 0.01$
- $Pr[T] = (0.8 \times 0.01) + (0.1 \times 0.99)$

```{r}
(0.8 * 0.01) / ((0.8 * 0.01) + (0.1 * 0.99))
```
