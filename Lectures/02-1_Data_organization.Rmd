## Goal for this week

**Take Care of Your Data**:

- Storing
- Loading
- Visualizing
- Validating

## Guidelines for data files

- Think about how to store your data _before_ you have data to store
    - Get it right the first time rather than to deal with bad decisions forever
- Keep everything.
    - Disk space is cheap.
    - Dropbox / Box / Google Drive / Sync, etc.
    - Iterate file names (or -- better -- use version control)
- Be consistent
    - File names, variable names, file formats, etc.
    - No spaces in data file names

## Guidelines for data files

- Store data in rectangular format
    - **No empty cells**, repeat values if necessary
- Use only one header row
    - Curse software that outputs more than one header row
- Use `NA` for missing data
- Use wide format
    - Each unique observation unit is a row

## Guidelines for data files

- No spaces or units in column names
    - `body_mass` or `BodyMass` but not "Body Mass" or "Body Mass (g)"
- Store dates as three separate columns (`Year`, `Month`, `Day`)
    - Excel does weird things with dates
    - With concatentation, it is easy to make date columns if you need them
    - We might be in the minority here.

## Guidelines for data files

- Create a data dictionary (explanations of what your columns represent)
    - Cell comments, a separate Excel sheet, or separate file
        - *Not in the column names*
    - "Body mass in grams, measured to nearest 0.1 g."
- Keep file sizes manageable
    - Do you need 384 columns in that Excel file?
    - Use shared numeric IDs so that you can match and merge data across files

## It would be nice to store data in csv files and edit in Excel, but...

Working with csv files in Excel _not_ a viable (i.e., non-aggravating) option.

- If you are entering data, use .xls or .xlsx and trust that translators will be available for as long as you are a scientist
- If you are outputting data from another program, use csv or tab-delimits (if your data has commas).

## Some hope: Comma Chameleon

- Simple, cross-platform csv editing.
