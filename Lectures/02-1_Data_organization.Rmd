## Data Organizing - File Structure

For each R project/manuscript, you will want to have a set of folders. Here is a suggestion, but there are many options.

\bigskip

- Main Project Folder
  - Data
  - Data Wrangling
  - Analysis
  - Graphics
  - Documents
  - ReadMe

## Data Organizing - File Structure {.smaller}

  - Data
    - raw data (read-only, pristine backup, not to be touched)
    - tidy data (intermediate and final R datasets)
  - Data Wrangling
    - DataAcquisition.R - script for compiling all data files into a single, usable dataset.
  - Analysis
  - Graphics
  - Documents
    - Manuscript folder
    - Literature folder
  - ReadMe
    - metadata
    - list the driving questions and purposes of the project and other notes.


*Note: Your code will stay cleaner if you use many smaller scripts, e.g. one for all analyses, one for all figures **OR** one for each analysis and the associated figures*


## Data Storing - General Tips 

- Think about how to store your data _before_ you start
    - Get it right the first time or deal with bad decisions forever
- Keep everything.
    - Disk space is cheap.
    - Dropbox / Box / Google Drive / Sync, etc.
    - Iterate file names (or -- better -- use version control)
- Create a data dictionary in your metadata folder (explanations of what your columns represent)
    - "Body mass in grams, measured to nearest 0.1 g."
- Be consistent
    - File names, variable names, file formats, etc.

## Data Storing - Guidelines for Data Files {.smaller}


1. Store data in rectangular format
    - **No empty cells**, repeat values if necessary
1. Use only one header row
    - Curse software that outputs more than one header row
1. R is case sensitive so keep column headers in a case structure  (e.g. snake_case, dot.case)
    - No spaces or units in column names. E.g. `body_mass` or `BodyMass` but not "Body Mass" or "Body Mass (g)"
1. Use `NA` for missing data
    - The difference between “0” and “NA” and a blank cell all tells you something
1. Use wide format
    - Each unique observation unit is a row
1. Store dates as three separate columns (`Year`, `Month`, `Day`)
    - Excel does weird things with dates

  

## Data Storing - Relational Data


-  Strive for relational data to keep your file size small 
    - store data as smaller units (hierarchical and by type) and link through code. 
    - Use shared numeric IDs so that you can match and merge data across files
    -  For example: store site level data in one file, and plot level data in another. Then link these datasets through code.
        - This helps avoid confusion and repetition
        -  Great for large, interconnected datasets, especially those that can change
    - Data management systems play well with data in this format (e.g. Tidy, SQL)

## It would be nice to store data in csv files and edit in Excel, but...

Working with csv files in Excel _not_ a viable (i.e., non-aggravating) option.

- If you are entering data, use .xls or .xlsx and trust that translators will be available for as long as you are a scientist
- If you are outputting data from another program, use csv or tab-delimits (if your data has commas).
