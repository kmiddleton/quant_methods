## Tests of arbitrary slopes and intercepts

$$t = \frac{\beta - \beta_{null}}{\mbox{SE}_{\beta}}$$

is a general equation that can be used to test any null hypothesized parameter estimate.

- $\beta$ is the parameter estimate
- $\beta_{null}$ is the null hypothesized value
    - often and by default $\beta_{null} = 0$

## What makes a model "linear"? When is a model non-linear?

Linear models:

- Response modeled by a combination of predictors where predictors are not in the exponents

$$y = \beta_ + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_k x_k$$

Interactions models (unit 9)

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + ... + \beta_k x_k$$


## Curved "linear" models? Yes.

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^2$$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(3947239)
D <- tibble(x = runif(20, 0, 10),
            y = 2 + x^2 + rnorm(10, 0, 4))
ggplot(D, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula=y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), method = "lm",
              se = FALSE)
```


## Transformations

All are linear models:

- Least squares regression
- *t*-tests, ANOVA, etc.
- Polynomials
- Roots
- Logarithms
- Generalized linear models (logistic, Poisson regression)


## Non-linear models

- Models that are not "linear models"
- Usually:
    - Predictors in the exponents
    - *e^x^*

Logistic growth:

$$f(x) = \frac{\beta_{max}}{1 + e^{-\beta_{rate}(x - \beta_{mid})}}$$

Additive logistic growth: 

$$f(age) = \frac{a_1}{1 + e^{(-b_1 (age - c_1))}} + \frac{f - a_1}{1 + e^{(-b_2 (age - c_2))}}$$


## Gompertz Growth Curve

$$f(t)=a\mathrm{e}^{-b\mathrm{e}^{-ct}}$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
set.seed(2364283)

n <- 20
a <- 20
b <- 0.5
c <- 10

D <- tibble(x = runif(n, 1, 20),
            y = a * exp(-1 * exp(-b * (x - c))) + rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)) %>% 
  mutate(y = abs(y))
p <- tibble(x = seq(2.5, 20, length.out = 200),
            pred = 0.45 + 19.23 * exp(-1 * exp(-0.58 * (x - 10.11))))

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = D, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(data = p, aes(x = x, y = pred), color = "blue")
```

- No analytical solution (can't use `lm()`)
- Need to use maximum likelihood or Bayesian approach
- Can be very challenging to fit.


## Programming

Lists, data.frames, and tibbles, and tables in loops

- Loops
- Functions
- Debugging code
- Map functions

Approaches:

- Start small, build up
- Stepwise additions, one change at a time
- Sanity check every step


## What is the expected distribution of P-values when there is no effect?

- Simulate data with no difference
- Extract P-value from summary
- Repeat many times
- Plot


## Publication ready figures

What you have been learning:

- `ggplot()`
- Theming: color, point and line size, text size, etc.
- Combining plots
    - `cowplot` package: `plot_grid()`
    - `patchwork` package: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/
- [ggpubr](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/24-ggpubr-publication-ready-plots/)
- [sjPlot](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/)
- [Big list of ggplot extensions](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2)


## General plan

- Basic plot looks OK in RStudio
- Determine the output size you want
    - Measure 1 or 2 column figure in the journal
- Save plot as PDF (`last_plot()` is the most recent plot)
    - `ggsave()` with `width =` and `height =`
    - `save_plot()` with `base_height =` and `base_width = `
- Open in PDF viewer
- Start changing elements in the theme iteratively
    - Define a theme
