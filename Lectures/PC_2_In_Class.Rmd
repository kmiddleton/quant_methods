## Clarifications on question wording 


## Models and Inference

- You want to use data to answer questions.
- Make *inferences* using *models* with data.

The method you use for inference is part of the model.

- Different sets of assumptions
- Many will give very similar answers

## Frameworks for Inference

1. Analytical
2. Maximum likelihood
3. Resampling (Monte Carlo)
4. Bayesian

Each is a tool with different costs and benefits.

## Confidence intervals

- Review CI simulation & exact CIs

</center>


## GLMs with 1 normally distributed outcome variable | a.k.a., "General Linear Models"

1. Continuous ~ $\ge$ 1 Continuous:  **OLS, correlation (Pearson r), multiple correlation (R)**
1. Continuous ~ $\ge$ 1 Categorical: **ANOVA, *t*-test**
1. Continuous ~ 1 Continuous + 1 Categorical: **ANCOVA**
1. Continuous ~ $\ge$ 1 Continuous + $\ge$ 1 Categorical: **Multiple regression**


## `anova()` vs. `lm()` vs. `aov()`

- Do we even need `t.test()`?


## Assumptions of linear models

- IID
- Normality of residuals
- Equality of variances

## What makes a model "linear"? When is a model non-linear?

Linear models:

- Response modeled by a combination of predictors where predictors are not in the exponents

$$y = \beta_ + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_k x_k$$

- Interactions models (unit 9)

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + ... + \beta_k x_k$$


## Curved "linear" models? Yes.

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^2$$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(3947239)
D <- tibble(x = runif(20, 0, 10),
            y = 2 + x^2 + rnorm(10, 0, 4))
ggplot(D, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula=y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), method = "lm",
              se = FALSE)
```


## Transformations

All are linear models:

- Least squares regression
- *t*-tests, ANOVA, etc.
- Polynomials
- Roots
- Logarithms
- Generalized linear models (logistic, Poisson regression)


## Non-linear models

- Models that are not "linear models"
- Usually:
    - Predictors in the exponents
    - Asymptotic

Logistic growth:

$$f(x) = \frac{\beta_{max}}{1 + e^{-\beta_{rate}(x - \beta_{mid})}}$$

Michaelisâˆ’Menten: 

$$f(x) = \frac{ax}{b+x}$$


## Gompertz Growth Curve

$$f(t)=a\mathrm{e}^{-b\mathrm{e}^{-ct}}$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
set.seed(2364283)

n <- 20
a <- 20
b <- 0.5
c <- 10

D <- tibble(x = runif(n, 1, 20),
            y = a * exp(-1 * exp(-b * (x - c))) + rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)) %>% 
  mutate(y = abs(y))
p <- tibble(x = seq(2.5, 20, length.out = 200),
            pred = 0.45 + 19.23 * exp(-1 * exp(-0.58 * (x - 10.11))))

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = D, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(data = p, aes(x = x, y = pred), color = "blue")
```

- No analytical solution (can't use `lm()`)
- Need to use maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference
- Can be very challenging to fit (starting values)


## Programming

Lists, data.frames, and tibbles, and tables in loops

- Loops
- Functions
- Debugging code
- Map functions

Approaches:

- Start small, build up
- Stepwise additions, one change at a time
- Sanity check every step


## What is the expected distribution of P-values when there is no effect?

- Simulate data with no difference
- Extract P-value from summary
- Repeat many times
- Plot
