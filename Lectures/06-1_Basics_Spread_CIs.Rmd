## Models

- Comparing models will require covering a few more basics
    - Recall concepts of central tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)
    - Concepts of spread
    - Deviations & sums of squares
    - Introduction to confidence intervals

## Measures of spread

- A measure of how much variation is present in a distribution around its center
- How widely scattered the observations are

## Percentiles and quantiles

The $X$th **percentile** of a sample is the value below which $X\%$ of the observations lie. Percentiles are reported as percent.

 **Quantile** = Percentile / 100%. The range of quantiles is $0 \rightarrow 1$.

```{r}
xx <- rnorm(100000)
quantile(xx, 0.84)
quantile(xx, 0.975)
```

## Quartiles and interquartile range

*Quartiles*

- Divide a set of data into quarters
- Minimum, maximum, 25th and 75th percentiles

*Interquartile range*

- Difference between the first and third quartiles

## Boxplots {.smaller}

Different variations, but the most standard recipe is:

1. Median = center line
2. Box = IQR (25th to 75th percentiles)
3. Whiskers at 1.5 X 25th and 75th percentiles
4. Dots for anything outside 1.5 X 25th and 75th percentiles

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center'}

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = genotype, y = plates)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.3), alpha = 0.5)

```


## Deviates

Lots of statistics have their basis in the deviation of an observation from a mean.

</center>

The $i$th deviate is the difference of that observation and the sample mean:

$$
\textrm{Deviate}_i = Y_i - \bar{Y}
$$

We would like to have a single number to summarize the deviates for a sample.

## Sum of squares

Deviates are most often squared and summed:

$$
SS = \sum \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)^2
$$

1. Why squared?
1. What does the sum of squares represent?

## Mean deviates

This is why we don't use the mean absolute deviation:

</center>

Absolute value wouldn't capture the greater variability in the right image.

## Sample variance

Sum of squares standardized by one minus the sample size ($n - 1$):

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)^2}{n - 1}
$$

- Mean squared deviation of the observations from the mean.
- Measures the dispersion of a distribution away from the sample mean.

## Sample standard deviation

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(Y_i - \bar{Y}\right)^2}{n - 1}}
$$

- Square root of the sample variance.
- Think of $s$ as the "mean" for deviation.
- About 68% of the observations are $\pm 1$ standard deviation from the mean.

- When sample size is not low, the sample variance ($s^2$) is an *unbiased estimator* of the population variance ($\sigma^2$), though the calculation is a little different (divide by $n$ rather than $n − 1$) See [explanation of $n$ vs. $n-1$](http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/3931/597) 

## Coefficient of variation

Coefficient of variation represents the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean. Elephant mass has an inherently higher standard deviation than mouse mass.

$$
CV = 100\% \times \frac{s}{\bar{Y}}
$$

- Can be used as a general indicator of the amount of variability in a sample.
- Can also be used to (cautiously) compare variables that are not measured in the same units (e.g., basal metabolic rate to ear area).

## Coefficient of variation

```{r}
CV <- 100 * sd(undulation_rate) / mean(undulation_rate)
CV
```

The coefficient of variation of undulation rate was `r round(CV, 1)`%.


## Standard error of the sample mean

$$SE_{\bar{Y}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Means are always reported with standard errors (or standard deviations).

- **Standard deviation** quantifies scatter — how much the values vary from one another and does not change predictably as you collect more data.
- **Standard error** of the mean quantifies how precisely you know the population mean. It takes into account both the value of $s$ and the sample size. Always decreases with larger sample size.

## Standard error of the sample mean

```{r}
SEM <- function(x) {sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))}

SticklebackPlates %>% 
  group_by(genotype) %>% 
  summarise_all(SEM)
  
```

## Raw data with summary stats

```{r pt_errbar, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = genotype, y = plates)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, color = "red") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1,
               color = "red", size = 1)
```

## Raw data with summary stats

```{r pt_errbar2, ref.label="pt_errbar", echo=FALSE}
```

## Confidence intervals

> A confidence interval is a range that we expect, with some level of conﬁdence, to include the true value of a population parameter such as the mean. [@Curran-Everett2009-zz]

Our calculation is based on our expectation from sampling the true population distribution repeatedly. 

## Confidence intervals

The 95% confidence interval for a mean can be estimated by the sample mean ± 2 \times $SE_{\bar{Y}}$.

- This is a reasonable approximation.
- We'll cover the exact calculation (what you would use in press) later

## Confidence intervals


```{r}
y_bar <- mean(undulation_rate)
se_y <- sd(undulation_rate) / sqrt(length(undulation_rate))
lower <- y_bar - 2 * se_y
upper <- y_bar + 2 * se_y
```

<div class="columns-2">

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.5, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(tibble(undulation_rate), aes(undulation_rate)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Undulation Rate (Hz)", y = "Count")
```

Mean undulation rate was `r round(y_bar, 2)` Hz ($n$ = `r length(undulation_rate)`; 95% CI = `r round(lower, 2)` - `r round(upper, 2)` Hz).
