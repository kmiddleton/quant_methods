# General course information

---

# What you need

- Laptop
- Enthusiasm

---

# Book, etc.

- There is no one-size-fits-all statistics textbook. Any that we chose would be a compromise.
- No official textbook. Many recommendations on Canvas if you are looking for a book.

---

# Online lectures

- Available Mondays (or sooner)
- Watch, rewatch, take notes, look up things you don't understand, etc.

---

# Quiz questions

- In between some of the lectures
    - e.g., Watch a lecture, answer some questions
- Not graded, but you do need to complete them.
