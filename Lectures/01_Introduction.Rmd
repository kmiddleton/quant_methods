# Goals for this course

- Be more comfortable with data analysis
   - Data exploration and plotting
- Recipes for analyses
   - Reuse what you have already done
   - Recognize when you can reuse
- Gain experience programming
- Design experiments that can be analyzed before you collect data
- Write about analyses and results
- Interpret what others have done (be good science consumers)

# Goals for *your future as a scientist*

- Be more comfortable with data analysis
    - Data exploration and plotting
- Recipes for analyses
    - Reuse what you have already done
    - Recognize when you can reuse
- Gain experience programming
- Design experiments that can be analyzed before you collect data
- Write about analyses and results
- Interpret what others have done (be good science consumers)

# Why do we need our own class?

- (Apparently) offerings from other departments are inadequate
    - Although the math is the same (Psychology, Sociology, or Mathematics)
    - Our examples should be more intuitive to you
- Unique combination of topics important to IA/Anthro/Bio students
    - Dimensionality reduction, classification
    - Phylogenetic comparative methods

---

# What you should already know

- A basic understanding of math is necessary (some notation)
    - Calculus-level understanding is not necessary
    - More important: an understanding of what goes into the math

---

# What you should already know

- General familiarity with some topics:
    - Kinds of variables and their distributions
    - Univariate (means, etc.) and bivariate (correlation, regression, one-way ANOVA) approaches
- We will use the first few meetings for review and extension of these topics
    - **Ask questions when you do not understand.**

---

# What we expect

- Participate
- Do the readings when applicable
- Do the problem sets conscientiously
- Persistence
    - Be willing to try and fail (and keep on trying)
- Know when to ask for help, and then ask for it
    - Exhaust your own options first
    - What will I do when I'm on my own?

# Safe statistics

> "[Statisticians] are at grave risk of becoming irrelevant, not because we are useless, but because we have focussed too much on doing the right thing, rather than doing something that works. As a field, statistics tends to lean towards abstinence based outreach: you should only do statistics if you're in a committed long-term relationship with a professional statistician. If you experiment on your own (or with friends), you will hurt yourself and others. Abstinence based approaches don't work because people will take the risk anyway, and most of the time they will safely enjoy themselves. ... Rather than stigmatizing amateur statistics, we should be doing
out best to provide tools to make it safer." - *Wickham (2015)*

---

# Course goals

1. Teach tools that help you be safe in your statistics (some degree of statistical literacy: reading, doing, writing)
1. Teach you common problems, pitfalls, and concerns
1. But don't induce *analysis paralysis* (Middleton, 2015)

---

# Course outline | Introductory concepts

- Review of basics
    - Probability
    - Sampling
    - Variables
    - Distributions
- Hypothesis testing (good and bad)

# Outline of topics

---

# Why R?

- Free; now and always
- Comprehensive and flexible (perhaps too much so for beginners)
- Portable code (Windows, OS X, Unix-like)
- Publication quality plotting
- Encourages good data analysis practices
    - No point and click
- I know it best

---

# R will become essential for scientists (you, your students)

- As important as Word and Excel
- Learn it now while you have time and energy

---

# Why not some other statistics program/language?

- You probably won't have careers as biostatisticians (SAS, Stata)
- Won't tie to you some non-free software (SAS, SPSS, Systat, Stata, NCSS/PASS, MATLAB)
- Huge data (>$10^6$ observations) is rarely an issue (SAS, Stata, python, julia)
- Speed is rarely an issue for us (fortran, julia, MATLAB, python)

---

# R will make you angry

- Unforgiving
- Opaque
- Inscrutable errors

---

# R will make you happy

- Takes time

---

# Why no Powerpoint slides?

- Inefficient to make slides
- No mechanism to seamlessly include R output & graphics
- Ugly equations
- Hard to keep track of changes
- Let something else handle formatting (R Markdown)
    - Nice HTML output
- Poor support for version control

---

# R $\neq$ RStudio

- RStudio is an interface to R
- R can be run without RStudio.
    - The reverse is not true.
- RStudio is the most important thing to ever happen to R
- These slides were written using RStudio.

---

# R Markdown {.smaller}

- Text-based markup language (i.e., HTML)
- Variant of markdown (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- Render to different formats (PDF, HTML, docx)
- Inline R code
    - Your text and analysis live together in one file
- Resources

# Data Sets and Examples

- We will reuse example data sets in different contexts
    - Get to know them, much as you will get to know your own data
    - Different analytical approaches to the same data
- We will use lots of my own data
- Know what your own statistical test should do
    - Make the math work with an example you trust
    - Then apply to your own data
