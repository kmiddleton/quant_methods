## Data Manipulation Goals -- Reminder

Once we have tidy data, we may need to update its format, create new variables, filter out other variables, etc.


- Perform all manipulation in R
    
    - Preserves data integrity
    - This will take a lot of time at first but is worth the effort
    - Remember Google is your friend!
