## Remember the Goal of Statistics

> "a way of taming **uncertainty**, of turning raw **data** into arguments that can resolve profound questions" [@Amabile1989-pf]

- The statistical analyses that you carry out are *models*.
- Inference depends on evaluating the relative support for different models.

## Example: Wing Dimorphic Crickets

> Do long-winged crickets have a higher resting metabolic rate than short-winged crickets?

Controlling for body mass,

- Metabolic rates do not differ
- Average metabolic rate of long-wings is higher
- Average  metabolic rate of long-wings is lower

## Example: Genetics of Corn Oil Content

> Which set of loci best predicts oil content in corn kernels?

<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/w6z5m2e.jpg" width="100%" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>

- Heritability of corn oil content is 0
- Different possible combinations of SNPs
- All additive
- Dominance
- Epistasis
- Structural variants

## Example: Canid relationships

> What are the phylogenetic relationships between dog breeds & other canids?

<div class="columns-2">

<br />
<br />

</center>

- Star phylogeny
- Single origin of dogs
- Ancient breeds are monophyletic
- Every possible tree....

## Example: Predict the species of a fossil

> Is this bone more like a chimpanzee, australopith, Neandertal, or modern human?

<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cQ1Kl1v.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>

- What are the relative probabilities of new fossil being in one of four taxonomic groups?
- What is the percent correct classification of known fossils?

## Example: Species Richness in Lakes

> Does the number of phytoplankton species change with agricultural intensity around lakes?


<div class="columns-2">

<center>
<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/GoOM9bb.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</center>

- There is no relationship between species richness and agricultural intensity
- There is a positive relationship
- There is a negative relationship

## Example: Alligator growth

> Do alligators exhibit determinate or indeterminate growth and does growth depend of atmospheric oxygen levels?

Determinate:

- von Bertalanffy
- Logistic

Indeterminate:

- Polynomial

</div>

## Example: Alligator growth

von Bertalanffy:

$$Femoral~Length\left(Age\right) = \theta_1 \left(1 - e^{-\theta_2 \left(Age - \theta_3\right)}\right)$$

Logistic:

$$Femoral~Length\left(Age\right) = \frac{\theta_1}{1 + e^{\frac{\theta_2 - Age}{\theta_3}}}$$

Polynomial:

$$Femoral~Length\left(Age\right) = a + b \cdot Age + c \cdot Age^2$$
