              the ability to physically compete for mates. However, species
              variation in social structure leads to differences in the
              relative importance of intraspecific aggression. Here we present
              a large comparative data set on sexual dimorphism in skeletal
              shape in Carnivora to test the hypotheses that carnivorans
              exhibit sexual dimorphism in skeletal anatomy that is reflective
              of greater specialization for physical aggression in males
              relative to females and that this dimorphism is associated with
              the intensity of sexual selection. We tested these hypotheses
              using a set of functional indices predicted to improve aggressive
              performance. Our results indicate that skeletal shape dimorphism
              is widespread within our sample. Functional traits thought to
              enhance aggressive performance are more pronounced in males.
              Phylogenetic model selection suggests that the evolution of this
              dimorphism is driven by sexual selection, with the best-fitting
              model indicating greater dimorphism in polygynous versus
              non-polygynous species. Skeletal shape dimorphism is correlated
              with body size dimorphism, a common indicator of the intensity of
              male-male competition, but not with mean body size. These results
              represent the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in the primary
              locomotor system of a large sample of mammals.",

              test the validity of a null hypothesis. Often, we test the
              validity of more than one null hypothesis. If we fail to use an
              appropriate procedure to account for this multiplicity, then we
              are more likely to reach a wrong scientific conclusion[---]we are
              more likely to make a mistake. In physiology, experiments that

              cite a multiple comparison procedure. In this review, I
              demonstrate the statistical issue embedded in multiple

              for the method using SPLUS is available from the author). The

              the pseudovalues of the estimates; these estimates can then be
              used as datapoints in a MANOVA. I illustrate the method using two

              results when either the underlying model is inappropriate or the
              data contain insufficient information to inform the inference.
              The ability to measure the statistical power of these methods has
              become crucial to ensure that data quantity keeps pace with
              growing model complexity. Through simulations, we show that
              commonly applied model choice methods based on information
              criteria can have remarkably high error rates; this can be a
              problem because methods to estimate the uncertainty or power are
              not widely known or applied. Furthermore, the power of
              comparative methods can depend significantly on the structure of
              the data. We describe a Monte Carlo-based method which addresses
              both of these challenges, and show how this approach both
              quantifies and substantially reduces errors relative to
              information criteria. The method also produces meaningful
              confidence intervals for model parameters. We illustrate how the
              power to distinguish different models, such as varying levels of
              selection, varies both with number of taxa and structure of the
              phylogeny. We provide an open-source implementation in the pmc
              (``Phylogenetic Monte Carlo'') package for the R programming

              morphological diversification of ruminants, in general, and in
              the differences between bovids and cervids, in particular. Using
              skull morphology, which embodies many of the adaptations that
              distinguish bovids and cervids, I examined 132 of the 200 extant
              ruminant species. As a proxy for intrinsic constraints, I
              quantified different aspects of the phenotypic covariation
              structure within species and compared them with the among-species
              divergence patterns, using phylogenetic comparative methods. My
              results show that for most species, divergence is well aligned
              with their phenotypic covariance matrix and that those that are
              better aligned have diverged further away from their ancestor.
              Bovids have dispersed into a wider range of directions in
              morphospace than cervids, and their overall disparity is higher.
              This difference is best explained by the lower eccentricity of
              bovids’ within-species covariance matrices. These results are
              consistent with the role of intrinsic constraints in determining
              amount, range, and direction of dispersion and demonstrate that

              hypotheses. Here, we report a study designed to overcome these
              issues. We first compiled a supermatrix of craniodental

              advantage of recently developed Bayesian methods for building
              trees of serially sampled tips to test among hypotheses that have

              comparative methods. In this context, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
              process is now being used extensively to model selectively driven
              trait evolution, whereby a trait is attracted to a selection
              optimum $\mu$. * We report here theoretical properties of the
              maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators for these parameters,
              including their non-uniqueness and inaccuracy, and show that
              theoretical expectations indeed apply to real trees. We provide

  abstract = "Background The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is widely
              used in biomedical research to assess the reproducibility of
              measurements between raters, labs, technicians, or devices. For
              example, in an inter-rater reliability study, a high ICC value
              means that noise variability (between-raters and within-raters)
              is small relative to variability from patient to patient. A
              confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval for the ICC is
              a commonly reported summary. Such intervals can be constructed
              employing either frequentist or Bayesian methodologies. Methods
              This study examines the performance of three different methods
              for constructing an interval in a two-way, crossed, random
              effects model without interaction: the Generalized Confidence
              Interval method (GCI), the Modified Large Sample method (MLS),
              and a Bayesian method based on a noninformative prior
              distribution (NIB). Guidance is provided on interval construction
              method selection based on study design, sample size, and
              normality of the data. We compare the coverage probabilities and
              widths of the different interval methods. Results We show that,
              for the two-way, crossed, random effects model without
              interaction, care is needed in interval method selection because
              the interval estimates do not always have properties that the
              user expects. While different methods generally perform well when
              there are a large number of levels of each factor, large
              differences between the methods emerge when the number of one or
              more factors is limited. In addition, all methods are shown to
              lack robustness to certain hard-to-detect violations of normality
              when the sample size is limited. Conclusions Decision rules and
              software programs for interval construction are provided for
              practical implementation in the two-way, crossed, random effects
              model without interaction. All interval methods perform similarly
              when the data are normal and there are sufficient numbers of
              levels of each factor. The MLS and GCI methods outperform the NIB
              when one of the factors has a limited number of levels and the
              data are normally distributed or nearly normally distributed.
              None of the methods work well if the number of levels of a factor
              are limited and data are markedly non-normal. The software
              programs are implemented in the popular R language. Electronic

              as a ‘screening’ procedure; one either reports some scientific
              findings, or alternatively gives no firm conclusions. These
              choices differ fundamentally from hypothesis testing, in the
              style of Neyman and Pearson, which does not consider a
              noncommittal response; tests are developed as choices between two
              complementary hypotheses, typically labeled ‘null’ and
              ‘alternative.’ The same choices are presented in typical Bayesian
              tests, where Bayes Factors are used to judge the relative support
              for a null or alternative model. In this article, we use decision
              theory to show that Bayesian tests can also describe Fisher-style
              ‘screening’ procedures, and that such approaches lead directly to
              Bayesian analogs of the Wald test and two-sided p-value, and to
              Bayesian tests with frequentist properties that can be determined

  abstract = "Statistical decision theory (SDT) is a sub-field of decision
              theory that formally incorporates statistical investigation into
              a decision-theoretic framework to account for uncertainties in a
              decision problem. SDT provides a unifying analysis of three types
              of information: statistical results from a data set, knowledge of
              the consequences of potential choices (i.e., loss), and prior
              beliefs about a system. SDT links the theoretical development of
              a large body of statistical methods including point estimation,
              hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation. The
              theory and application of SDT have mainly been developed and
              published in the fields of mathematics, statistics, operations
              research, and other decision sciences, but have had limited
              exposure in ecology. Thus, we provide an introduction to SDT for
              ecologists and describe its utility for linking the
              conventionally separate tasks of statistical investigation and
              decision making in a single framework. We describe the basic
              framework of both Bayesian and frequentist SDT, its traditional
              use in statistics, and discuss its application to decision
              problems that occur in ecology. We demonstrate SDT with two types
              of decisions: Bayesian point estimation, and an applied
              management problem of selecting a prescribed fire rotation for
              managing a grassland bird species. Central to SDT, and decision
              theory in general, are loss functions. Thus, we also provide
              basic guidance and references for constructing loss functions for
              an SDT problem. This article is protected by copyright. All

  author   = "Still, Susanne and Bialek, William",
  abstract = "Clustering provides a common means of identifying structure in
              complex data, and there is renewed interest in clustering as a
              tool for the analysis of large data sets in many fields. A
              natural question is how many clusters are appropriate for the
              description of a given system. Traditional approaches to this
              problem are based on either a framework in which clusters of a
              particular shape are assumed as a model of the system or on a
              two-step procedure in which a clustering criterion determines the
              optimal assignments for a given number of clusters and a separate
              criterion measures the goodness of the classification to
              determine the number of clusters. In a statistical mechanics
              approach, clustering can be seen as a trade-off between energy-
              and entropy-like terms, with lower temperature driving the
              proliferation of clusters to provide a more detailed description
              of the data. For finite data sets, we expect that there is a
              limit to the meaningful structure that can be resolved and
              therefore a minimum temperature beyond which we will capture
              sampling noise. This suggests that correcting the clustering
              criterion for the bias that arises due to sampling errors will
              allow us to find a clustering solution at a temperature that is
              optimal in the sense that we capture maximal meaningful
              structure--without having to define an external criterion for the
              goodness or stability of the clustering. We show that in a
              general information-theoretic framework, the finite size of a
              data set determines an optimal temperature, and we introduce a
              method for finding the maximal number of clusters that can be
              resolved from the data in the hard clustering limit.",

              clusters the observations using the full set of features. We
              propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one
              clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of
              the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the
              features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for
              sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single
              criterion governs both the selection of the features and the

              temporally over the lifetime of an individual. Unlike geographic
              contexts, where different selective regimes can act on different
              alleles, age-specific selection is constrained to act on the same
              genome by altering age-specific expression. Snake venoms are
              exceptional traits for studying ontogeny because toxin expression
              variation directly changes the phenotype; relative amounts of
              venom components determine, in part, venom efficacy. Phenotypic
              integration is the dependent relationship between different
              traits that collectively produce a complex phenotype and, in
              venomous snakes, may include traits as diverse as venom, head
              shape and fang length. We examined the feeding system of the
              eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) across
              environments and over the lifetime of individuals and used a
              genotype--phenotype map approach, protein expression data and
              morphological data to demonstrate that: (i) ontogenetic effects
              explained more of the variation in toxin expression variation
              than geographic effects, (ii) both juveniles and adults varied
              geographically, (iii) toxin expression variation was a result of
              directional selection and (iv) different venom phenotypes
              covaried with morphological traits also associated with feeding
              in temporal (ontogenetic) and geographic (functional) contexts.
              These data are the first to demonstrate, to our knowledge,
              phenotypic integration between multiple morphological characters
              and a biochemical phenotype across populations and age classes.
              We identified copy number variation as the mechanism driving the
              difference in the venom phenotype associated with these

              and morphological divergence between northern and southern clades

              supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular
              disease. Trials were included if direct costs >\$500,000/year,
              participants were adult humans, and the primary outcome was
              cardiovascular risk, disease or death. The 55 trials meeting
              these criteria were coded for whether they were published prior
              to or after the year 2000, whether they registered in
              clinicaltrials.gov prior to publication, used active or placebo
              comparator, and whether or not the trial had industry
              co-sponsorship. We tabulated whether the study reported a
              positive, negative, or null result on the primary outcome
              variable and for total mortality. Results 17 of 30 studies (57\%)
              published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of
              intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among

              biotelemetry as they provide a means of measuring an animal's
              activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct
              observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data
              there is a natural dependence between observations of movement or
              behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses.
              Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been
              explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models
              (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, either a supervised
              or an unsupervised learning approach can be applied. Under a
              supervised context, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled
              acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories,
              whereas we will demonstrate how an unsupervised learning approach
              can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour. We will
              provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in
              both the supervised and unsupervised context, and discuss the
              data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to
              marine and aerial systems (sharks and eagles) taking the
              unsupervised approach, which is more readily applicable to animal
              activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the
              effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal
              behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify
              important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence
              behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the
              main features commonly observed in accelerometer data. The
              ability to combine direct observations of animals activity and
              combine it with statistical models which account for the features
              of accelerometer data offer a new way to quantify animal

              some measure of behavior to variation in heredity only if the
              effects of heredity and environment are truly additive.
              Additivity is often tested by examining the interaction effect in
              a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or its equivalent multiple
              regression model. If this effect is not statistically significant
              at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level, it is common practice in certain
              fields (e.g., human behavior genetics) to conclude that the two
              factors really are additive and then to use linear models, which
              assume additivity. Comparing several simple models of
              nonadditive, interactive relationships between heredity and
              environment, however, reveals that ANOVA often fails to detect
              nonadditivity because it has much less power in tests of
              interaction than in tests of main effects. Likewise, the sample
              sizes needed to detect real interactions are substantially
              greater than those needed to detect main effects. Data
              transformations that reduce interaction effects also change
              drastically the properties ofthe causal model and may conceal
              theoretically interesting and practically useful relationships.
              If the goal ofpartitioning variance among mutually exclusive
              causes and calculating ``heritability'' coefficients is
              abandoned, interactive relationships can be examined more

              orthogonal null contrasts such that the maximum number (r)

              Type I error rate is defined as the expected proportion of the v1
              decisions which will be errors when all nulls are true. Because
              the new criterion uses F, the expected proportion of rejections
              can be calculated for the case when all nulls are not true, and
              this is taken as the definition of power. Theoretical means are
              deducible from decisions for v1 mutually orthogonal contrasts

              values, there is no ambiguity about the theoretical means. The

              that all vertebrates follow this pattern of progressive sutural
              closure has been used to assess maturity in the fossil remains of
              non-avian dinosaurs. Here, we test this assumption in two members
              of the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket of the Dinosauria, the emu,
              Dromaius novaehollandiae and the American alligator, Alligator
              mississippiensis, by investigating the sequence and timing of
              sutural fusion in their skulls. As expected, almost all the
              sutures in the emu skull progressively close (i.e., they get
              narrower) and then obliterate during ontogeny. However, in the
              American alligator, only two sutures out of 36 obliterate
              completely and they do so during embryonic development.
              Surprisingly, as maturity progresses, many sutures of alligators
              become wider in large individuals compared to younger, smaller
              individuals. Histological and histomorphometric analyses on two
              sutures and one synchondrosis in an ontogenetic series of

              pattern of sutural widening might reflect feeding biomechanics

              progressive sutural closure is not always observed in extant

              an ambiguous proxy for assessing maturity in non-avian dinosaurs.",

              America. Stepwise regression analyses were performed, assuming
              that measures of environmental diversity (especially area) and of
              isolation (interisland distances) permit prediction of species
              numbers and numbers of endemics in a continental situation, as
              they do in archipelagos. With seven independent variables
              included in the equations, prediction of species diversity and
              endemism was extremely good. From 92\% to 97\% of the variance in
              species numbers can be accounted for by regression, the best fit
              (97\%) being obtained with a linear model. From 87\% to 93\% of
              the variance in number of endemics can be predicted by
              regression, a semilog model providing the best fit (93 \% ). The
              Andean islands conform to archipelagos in two ways: first,
              because the species-area curve offers a reasonable prediction, as
              a first approximation, of species numbers; and second, because
              the numbers of endemics can best be predicted by some measure of
              interisland distance. The paramo islands differ from oceanic
              islands, however, because the distance effect curve is more
              linear than exponential, and because there is no statistically
              significant correlation between endemism and area of islands.
              These differences can be explained if isolation between islands
              is less absolute, so that the probability distribution of
              dispersal away from a source area is uniform, instead of
              exponential or normal.",

  abstract = "Recurrent tree defoliation by pastoralists, akin to herbivory,
              can negatively affect plant reproduction and population dynamics.
              However, our understanding of the indirect role of defoliation in
              seedling recruitment and tree--grass dynamics in tropical savanna
              is limited. In West African savanna, Fulani pastoralists
              frequently defoliate several fodder tree species to feed
              livestock in the dry season. We investigated the direct and
              indirect effects of recurrent defoliation of African mahogany
              (Khaya senegalensis) by Fulani people on seedling (<2 cm basal
              diameter) and sapling dynamics in West Africa using four years of
              demographic data on seedling and sapling density, growth, and
              survival, coupled with fruit production and microhabitat data
              over the same time period. Tree canopy cover facilitated
              seedlings but had negative effects on sapling growth possibly via
              intraspecific competition with adult plants. Interspecific
              competition with grasses strongly reduced seedling survival but
              had a weak effect on sapling growth. Fire reduced seedling
              survival and weakly reduced growth of seedlings and saplings, but
              did not affect sapling survival. These results indicate that the
              effect of fire on seedlings and saplings is distinct, a mechanism
              suitable for an episodic recruitment of seedlings into the
              sapling stage and consistent with predictions from the
              demographic bottleneck model. Defoliation affected seedling
              density and sapling growth through changes in canopy cover, but
              had no effect on seedling growth and sapling survival. In the
              moist region, sapling density was higher in sites with
              low-intensity defoliation, indicating that defoliation may
              strengthen the tree recruitment bottleneck. Our study suggests
              that large-scale defoliation can alter the facilitative role of
              nurse trees on seedling dynamics and tree--sapling competition.
              Given that tree defoliation by local people is a widespread
              activity throughout savanna--forest systems in West Africa, it
              has the potential to affect tree--grass coexistence.
              Incorporating the influence of large tree defoliation into
              existing models of savanna dynamics can further our understanding
              of tree--grass coexistence and improve management. A rotating
              harvest system, which allows seedlings to recruit episodically,
              or a patchwork harvest, which maintains some nursery trees in the
              mosaic, could help sustain seedling recruitment and minimize the
              indirect effects of harvest.",

              populi-transversus in Eastern North America",
  author   = "Sokal, Robert R",
  abstract = "1. An earlier study (Sokal, 1952) of character variation in the
              gall making aphid Pemphigus populi-transversus was extended to
              investigate character relations among localities in eastern North
              America. 2. Twenty-three localities of 15 galls each ranging from
              Massachusetts to Kansas and Wisconsin to Florida were used in the
              study. Eighteen characters were measused on two alates per gall.
              The study involved 12,420 measurements on 690 aphids. 3.
              Hierarchic analyses of variance showed that almost every
              character differed significantly among localities and most
              differed among galls within localities. These analyses permitted
              the study of the percentage of variation attributable to each
              level of variation; this is shown in table 1. 4. The hierarchic
              structure of these data made it possible to compute five separate
              correlation matrices, product-moment matrices at the intragall,
              intergall, and interlocality levels, and component correlation
              matrices at the intergall and interlocality levels. Appreciable
              differences among the three levels of correlation were observed.
              The product-moment correlation matrices at the higher levels
              appear to be intermediate between the next lower matrix and the
              appropriate component correlation matrix. 5. The differences in
              the correlation matrices are reflected by cluster analyses of
              some of the highest correlations (shown in figs. 2, 3, and 4).
              The highest correlations at the intragall level exhibit a
              regional morphogenetic pattern, while those at the intergall and
              interlocality levels appear to be adaptational trends not
              necessarily of adjacent structures and not immediately related to
              morphogenesis. 6. Multiple factor analysis with rotation to
              simple structure was undertaken on all correlation matrices.
              Partial results are shown in table 5. In all but one correlation
              matrix, three common factors appear to account for nearly all of
              the observed correlations. 7. The differences in factor pattern
              must be caused by different genetic and environmental variation
              patterns at the different hierarchic levels in this study. The
              implications of this phenomenon for sampling problems in studies
              of geographic variation is discussed. 8. By means of factor
              analysis one is able to determine a few common factors, which
              represent the variational patterns in the species at the level
              which one wishes to study.",

  author   = "Sokal, Robert R",
  abstract = "1. A local population of the gallmaking aphid Pemphigus
              populi-transversus was studied with a view to finding characters
              suitable for a study of intraspecific variation. 2. Twenty-eight
              galls, representing that number of clones, were used and the stem
              mother and four alates of each gall were measured. Twenty-one
              characters were measured for each alate and eight for each stem
              mother. 3. Means and coefficients of variation are given for each
              character measured. The values of the latter are relatively high
              due to anormality of the data. 4. By analysis of variance, one
              continuous and six meristic alate characters were shown to lack
              intergall variance and thus owe their variation to intragall,
              environmental factors only. The remaining alate characters
              exhibit significant variance between galls. 5. An analysis of
              covariance demonstrated that the intergall variance of thorax
              length accounts for much of the intergall variances of other
              alate characters. Thus thorax length was found to be the most
              representative alate character. 6. Other characters were chosen
              on the basis of their relative independence from thorax length.
              Forewing length, thorax width, femur length and antennal segment
              IV length were so chosen. 7. Total correlation coefficients were
              calculated and showed a lack of correlation between the
              non-significant meristic characters and other characters as well
              as high correlations among the significant characters. 8. The
              total correlation coefficients were partitioned into intragall
              and intergall correlation coefficients. There are low
              non-hereditary intragall correlations between characters, while
              the intergall correlation are high for all significant
              characters. 9. Stem mother characters showed low correlations
              among themselves and with alate characters, except for stem
              mother total length which is well correlated with alate
              characters. 10. The assumption that intergall variance is in part
              due to genetic factors is made and defended. 11. The presence of
              a general size factor of probably genetic origin is believed
              demonstrated for the first time in insects. There is some
              indication of group size factors. 12. Non-genetic special size
              factors are shown for some characters and there is some evidence
              that intragall correlations are a function of distance between
              correlated characters. 13. Pearson's rule on correlations can be
              shown in modified form in antennal and leg correlations.",

              forest plots of New England to test two general assembly rules:
              reduced co-occurrence of species among communities, and even
              spacing of body sizes of species within communities. We used null
              models to generate random communities unstructured by competition
              and evaluated patterns at regional and local spatial scales. At
              the regional scale, species co-occurrence in forests, but not
              bogs, was less than expected by chance, whereas, at the local
              scale, co-occurrence in both habitats was not different from
              random. At the regional scale, spacing of body size distributions
              was random (in bogs) or aggregated (in forests). At the local
              scale, body size patterns were weakly segregated in bogs, but
              random or weakly aggregated in forests. In bogs, size ratio
              constancy was accompanied by greater generic diversity than

              vertebrate communities, they successfully explained some patterns

              contingent on spatial scale, and were distinctly different for
              bog and forest communities, despite their close proximity and the
              presence of many shared species in both assemblages. The harsh

              Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, using data in Holmes et
              al. (1979). Fourteen categories of foraging behavior were
              ordinated by reciprocal averaging. The first and second derived
              axes accounted for 61\% of the total variance, and distinguished
              foraging substrate and maneuver. A morphological space was
              defined by eight external measurements. The correspondence
              between the positions of species in spaces defined by reciprocal
              averaging and morphology was determined by canonical correlation

              first (R^2 = 0.94) related substrate utilization to the lengths
              of the tarsus and midtoe, and the second (R^2 = 0.70) related
              foraging maneuver to midtoe length. The canonical correlation

  title    = "Set Correlation As A General Multivariate {Data-Analytic} Method",
  author   = "Cohen, Jacob",
  abstract = "Set correlation is a multivariate generalization of multiple
              regression/correlation analysis that features the employment of
              overall measures of association interpretable as proportions of
              variance and the use of set-partialled sets of variables, e.g.
              D·C with B·A. Partialling is a powerful device that may be used
              for statistical control and for representing non-linear and
              conditional (interactive) relationships, contrast functions, and
              the uniqueness of a variable or subset of variables. Generally,
              it offers a means for specifying functional components of sets.
              Since information in virtually any form can be represented as a
              set, partialled if necessary, the extension of partialling to
              sets of dependent variables makes it possible, within a single
              framework, to study relationships that are currently handled by
              diverse methods. Because of its flexibility and generality,
              beyond its capacity to handle the standard multivariate methods
              as special cases, set correlation offers some useful novel
              data-analytic techniques, among which are illustrated a
              hierarchical analysis of common and unique aspects of a battery,
              multivariate contrasts among outcomes, the multivariate analysis
              of partial variance, and contingency table analysis.",

              consequences are increasingly important for understanding and
              conserving biodiversity in the face of rapid global change.
              Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature
              sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed
              consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular
              species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources
              based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe
              PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life
              history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently
              extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of
              holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a
              species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant
              and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period
              of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial
              databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and
              anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are
              extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input
              format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature,
              species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation
              procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into
              species-level values for each variable. Tables of the
              consolidated species-level values are made available for each of
              two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as
              well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input

              researchers on how to structure and codify life-history,
              ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract
              meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive
              information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions,
              and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary
              analyses of this important clade. The complete data sets

  abstract = "We use data from the literature to compare two statistical
              procedures for estimating mass (or size) of quadrupedal dinosaurs
              and other extraordinarily large animals in extinct lineages. Both
              methods entail extrapolation from allometric equations fitted to
              data for a reference group of contemporary animals having a body
              form similar to that of the dinosaurs. The first method is the
              familiar one of fitting a straight line to logarithmic
              transformations, followed by back-transformation of the resulting
              equation to a two-parameter power function in the arithmetic
              scale. The second procedure entails fitting a two-parameter power
              function directly to arithmetic data for the extant forms by
              nonlinear regression. In the example presented here, the summed
              circumferences for humerus plus femur for 33 species of
              quadrupedal mammals was the predictor variable in the reference
              sample and body mass was the response variable. The allometric
              equation obtained by back-transformation from logarithms was not
              a good fit to the largest species in the reference sample and
              presumably led to grossly inaccurate estimates for body mass of
              several large dinosaurs. In contrast, the allometric equation
              obtained by nonlinear regression described data in the reference
              sample quite well, and it presumably resulted in better estimates
              for body mass of the dinosaurs. The problem with the traditional
              analysis can be traced to change in the relationship between
              predictor and response variables attending transformation,
              thereby causing measurements for large animals not to be weighted
              appropriately in fitting models by least squares regression.
              Extrapolations from statistical models obtained by
              back-transformation from lines fitted to logarithms are unlikely
              to yield reliable predictions for body size in extinct animals.
              Numerous reports on the biology of dinosaurs, including recent
              studies of growth, may need to be reconsidered in light of our

              Ecological observations now include diverse types of data

              the global, and at temporal scales ranging from nanoseconds to

              Ecological debates often revolve around issues of fundamental
              statistical theory and require the development of novel
              statistical methods. In short, if we want to test hypotheses,

  abstract = "The standard approach to most allometric research is to gather
              data on a biological function and a measure of body size, convert
              the data to logarithms, display the new values in a bivariate
              plot, and then fit a straight line to the transformations by the
              method of least squares. The slope of the fitted line provides an
              estimate for the allometric (or scaling) exponent, which often is
              interpreted in the context of underlying principles of structural
              and functional design. However, interpretations of this sort are
              based on the implicit assumption that the original data conform
              with a power function having an intercept of 0 on a plot with
              arithmetic coordinates. Whenever this assumption is not
              satisfied, the resulting estimate for the allometric exponent may
              be seriously biased and misleading. The problem of identifying an
              appropriate function is compounded by the logarithmic
              transformations, which alter the relationship between the

              outliers having an undue influence on properties of the fitted
              equation, including the estimate for the allometric exponent.
              Much of the current controversy in allometric research probably
              can be traced to substantive biases introduced by investigators
              who followed standard practice. We illustrate such biases with

              accompanies traditional allometric analyses and that often causes
              allometric equations to be inaccurate and misleading. The first
              investigation focused on the scaling of evaporative water loss to
              body mass in passerine birds; the second was concerned with the
              influence of body size on field metabolic rates of rodents; and
              the third addressed interspecific variation in kidney mass among
              primates. Straight lines were fitted to logarithmic
              transformations by Ordinary Least Squares and Generalized Linear
              Models, and the resulting equations then were re-expressed as
              two-parameter power functions in the original arithmetic scales.
              The re-expressed models were displayed on bivariate graphs

  abstract = "Several attempts have been made in recent years to formulate a
              general explanation for what appear to be recurring patterns of
              allometric variation in morphology, physiology, and ecology of
              both plants and animals (e.g. the Metabolic Theory of Ecology,
              the Allometric Cascade, the Metabolic-Level Boundaries
              hypothesis). However, published estimates for parameters in
              allometric equations often are inaccurate, owing to undetected
              bias introduced by the traditional method for fitting lines to
              empirical data. The traditional method entails fitting a straight
              line to logarithmic transformations of the original data and then
              back-transforming the resulting equation to the arithmetic scale.
              Because of fundamental changes in distributions attending
              transformation of predictor and response variables, the
              traditional practice may cause influential outliers to go
              undetected, and it may result in an underparameterized model
              being fitted to the data. Also, substantial bias may be
              introduced by the insidious rotational distortion that
              accompanies regression analyses performed on logarithms.
              Consequently, the aforementioned patterns of allometric variation
              may be illusions, and the theoretical explanations may be wide of
              the mark. Problems attending the traditional procedure can be
              largely avoided in future research simply by performing
              preliminary analyses on arithmetic values and by validating
              fitted equations in the arithmetic domain. The goal of most
              allometric research is to characterize relationships between
              biological variables and body size, and this is done most
              effectively with data expressed in the units of measurement.
              Back-transforming from a straight line fitted to logarithms is
              not a generally reliable way to estimate an allometric equation

              functional relationships in biology. Recently the common practice
              of fitting power laws using linear regression (LR) on
              log-transformed data has been criticized, calling into question
              the conclusions of hundreds of studies. It has been suggested
              that nonlinear regression (NLR) is preferable, but no rigorous
              comparison of these two methods has been conducted. Using Monte
              Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the error distribution
              determines which method performs better, with NLR better
              characterizing data with additive, homoscedastic, normal error
              and LR better characterizing data with multiplicative,
              heteroscedastic, lognormal error. Analysis of 471 biological
              power laws shows that both forms of error occur in nature. While
              previous analyses based on log-transformation appear to be
              generally valid, future analyses should choose methods based on a
              combination of biological plausibility and analysis of the error
              distribution. We provide detailed guidelines and associated

              But this creates a problem: percent change is really just a
              ratio, and a ratio is infamous for its ability to mislead. This
              means we may fail to find a group difference that does exist, or
              we may find a group difference that does not exist. What kind of

              infinite-dimensional parameter spaces with independent or
              Markovian data. Necessary conditions for consistency include the
              prior putting enough weight on the correct neighborhoods of the
              data-generating distribution; various sufficient conditions
              further restrict the prior in ways analogous to capacity control
              in frequentist nonparametrics. The asymptotics of Bayesian
              updating with mis-specified models or priors, or non-Markovian
              data, are far less well explored. Here I establish sufficient
              conditions for posterior convergence when all hypotheses are
              wrong, and the data have complex dependencies. The main dynamical
              assumption is the asymptotic equipartition
              (Shannon-McMillan-Breiman) property of information theory. This,
              along with Egorov’s Theorem on uniform convergence, lets me build
              a sieve-like structure for the prior. The main statistical
              assumption, also a form of capacity control, concerns the
              compatibility of the prior and the data-generating process,
              controlling the fluctuations in the log-likelihood when averaged
              over the sieve-like sets. In addition to posterior convergence, I
              derive a kind of large deviations principle for the posterior
              measure, extending in some cases to rates of convergence, and
              discuss the advantages of predicting using a combination of
              models known to be wrong. An appendix sketches connections

              Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship
              between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the
              institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically
              produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional
              hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative
              interaction models have been found to capture their intuition
              quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals
              from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is
              often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that
              considerable progress in our understanding of the political world

              sharp increase in use of complex research designs and complex
              statistical analyses in communication research. An informal
              examination of studies from 2 leading communication journals
              suggests that the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is often the
              statistic of choice, and a substantial proportion of published
              research reports using ANOVA employ complex (k $\geq$ 3)
              factorial designs, often involving multiple dependent variables.
              This article reports a series of Monte Carlo simulations which
              demonstrate that this complexity may come at a heavier cost than
              many communication researchers realize. As frequently used,
              complex factorial ANOVA yield Type I and Type II error rates that
              many communication scholars would likely consider unacceptable.
              Consequently, quality of statistical inference in many studies is
              highly suspect. Communication researchers are warned about

  abstract  = "I used confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the ability of
               causal developmental models to predict observed phenotypic
               integration in limb and skull measures at five stages of
               postnatal ontogeny in the laboratory rat. To analyze the
               dynamics of phenotypic integration, I fit successive age-classes
               simultaneously to a common model. Growth was the principal
               developmental explanation of observed phenotypic covariation in
               the limb and skull. No complex morphogenetic model more
               adequately reconstructed observed covariance structure. Models
               that could not be interpreted in embryological terms, coupled
               with a growth component, provide the best models for observed
               phenotypic integration. During postnatal growth, some aspects of
               integration vary in both the skull and limb. The covariance
               between factors and the proportion of variance unique to each
               character differ between some sequential age-classes. The
               factor-pattern is invariant in the limb; however, repatterning
               in the skull occurs in the interval between eye-opening and
               weaning. The temporal variation in the structure of covariation
               suggests that functional interactions among characters may
               create observed patterns of phenotypic integration. The
               developmental constraints responsible for evolutionary
               modification of phenotypes might be equally dynamic and
               responsive to embryonic functional interactions.",

                 needs. At the same time, this success generated a plethora of
                 concepts for error rate and power, as well as multiplicity of
                 methods for addressing them. These confuse the users of our
                 methodology and pose a threat. To avoid the threat, it is our
                 responsibility to match our theoretical goals to the goals of
                 the users of statistics. Only then should we match the methods
                 to the theoretical goals. Considerations related to such needs

                 testing or estimation, decision making or scientific
                 reporting. I then further argue that the vitality of our field

  abstract  = "Modern computer-intensive statistical methods play a key role in
               solving many problems across a wide range of scientific
               disciplines. This new edition of the bestselling Randomization,
               Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology illustrates the
               value of a number of these methods with an emphasis on
               biological applications. This textbook focuses on three related
               areas in computational statistics: randomization, bootstrapping,
               and Monte Carlo methods of inference. The author emphasizes the
               sampling approach within randomization testing and confidence
               intervals. Similar to randomization, the book shows how
               bootstrapping, or resampling, can be used for confidence
               intervals and tests of significance. It also explores how to use
               Monte Carlo methods to test hypotheses and construct confidence
               intervals.New to the Third EditionUpdated information on
               regression and time series analysis, multivariate methods,

               Design in the second half. All topics are presented in a precise
               and clear style supported with solved examples, numbered
               formulae, graphic illustrations, and ``Comments'' to provide
               depth and statistical accuracy and precision. Applications used
               within the text and the hallmark problems, exercises, projects,
               and case studies are drawn from virtually all disciplines and
               fields providing motivation for students in virtually any
               college. The Fifth edition provides an increased use of
               computing and graphical analysis throughout, without sacrificing
               concepts or rigor. In general, the 5e uses larger data sets in
               examples and exercises, and the use of automated software
               without loss of understanding.",

  abstract = "Studies of character evolution often assume that a phylogeny's
              shape is determined independently of the characters, which then
              evolve as mere passengers along the tree's branches. However, if
              the characters help shape the tree, but this is not considered,
              biased inferences can result. Simulations of asymmetrical
              speciation (i.e., one character state conferring a higher rate of
              speciation than another) result in data that are interpreted to
              show a higher rate of change toward the diversification-enhancing
              state, even though the rates to and from this state were in fact
              equal. Conversely, simulations of asymmetrical character change
              yield data that could be misinterpreted as showing asymmetrical
              rates of speciation. Studies of biased diversification and biased
              character change need to be unified by joint models and
              estimation methods, although how successfully the two processes

               scientists study chimpanzee cognition, for example, they compare
               chimp performance on cognitive tasks to the performance of human
               children on the same tasks. And when new fossils are found, such
               as those of the tiny humans of Flores, scientists compare these
               remains to other fossils and contemporary humans. Comparison
               provides a way to draw general inferences about the evolution of
               traits and therefore has long been the cornerstone of efforts to
               understand biological and cultural diversity. Individual studies
               of fossilized remains, living species, or human populations are
               the essential units of analysis in a comparative study; bringing
               these elements into a broader comparative framework allows the
               puzzle pieces to fall into place, creating a means of testing
               adaptive hypotheses and generating new ones. With this book,

  abstract = "The study of information-processing adaptations in the brain is
              controversial, in part because of disputes about the form such
              adaptations might take. Many psychologists assume that
              adaptations come in two kinds, specialized and general-purpose.
              Specialized mechanisms are typically thought of as innate,
              domain-specific, and isolated from other brain systems, whereas
              generalized mechanisms are developmentally plastic,
              domain-general, and interactive. However, if brain mechanisms
              evolve through processes of descent with modification, they are
              likely to be heterogeneous, rather than coming in just two kinds.
              They are likely to be hierarchically organized, with some design
              features widely shared across brain systems and others specific
              to particular processes. Also, they are likely to be largely
              developmentally plastic and interactive with other brain systems,
              rather than canalized and isolated. This article presents a
              hierarchical model of brain specialization, reviewing evidence
              for the model from evolutionary developmental biology, genetics,
              brain mapping, and comparative studies. Implications for the
              search for uniquely human traits are discussed, along with ways
              in which conventional views of modularity in psychology may need
              to be revised.",

              from related species should be performed taking into account
              their phylogenetic relationships. We introduce a new method,
              based on the use of generalized estimating equations (GEE), for
              the analysis of comparative data. The principle is to
              incorporate, in the modelling process, a correlation matrix that
              specifies the dependence among observations. This matrix is
              obtained from the phylogenetic tree of the studied species. Using
              this approach, a variety of distributions (discrete or
              continuous) can be analysed using a generalized linear modelling
              framework, phylogenies with multichotomies can be analysed, and
              there is no need to estimate ancestral character state. A
              simulation study showed that the proposed approach has good
              statistical properties with a type-I error rate close to the
              nominal 5\%, and statistical power to detect correlated evolution
              between two characters which increases with the strength of the
              correlation. The proposed approach performs well for the analysis
              of discrete characters. We illustrate our approach with some data
              on macro-ecological correlates in birds. Some extensions of the
              use of GEE are discussed.",

              and shape in a diversity of animal clades to test a key model of
              adaptive radiation, in which initially rapid morphological
              evolution is followed by relative stasis. We compared the fit of
              this model to both single selective peak and random walk models.
              We found little support for the early-burst model of adaptive
              radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of
              selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we found
              that the net rate of morphological evolution varied inversely
              with clade age. The youngest clades appear to evolve most rapidly
              because long-term change typically does not attain the amount of
              divergence predicted from rates measured over short time scales.
              Across our entire analysis, the dominant pattern was one of
              constraints shaping evolution continually through time rather
              than rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the
              classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological
              evolution is initially rapid and slows through time, may be rare
              in comparative data.",

  title    = "Use and Misuse of Mixed Model Analysis of Variance in Ecological
              Studies",
  author   = "Bennington, Cynthia and Thayne, William",
  abstract = "Analysis of variance is one of the most commonly used statistical
              techniques among ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Because
              many ecological experiments involve random as well as fixed
              effects, the most appropriate analysis of variance model to use
              is often the mixed model. Consideration of effects in an analysis
              of variance as fixed or random is critical if correct tests are
              to be made and if correct inferences are to be drawn from these
              tests. A literature review was conducted to determine whether
              authors are generally aware of the differences between fixed and
              random effects and whether they are performing analyses
              consistent with their consideration. All articles (excluding
              Notes and Comments) in Ecology and Evolution for the years 1990
              and 1991 were reviewed. In general, authors that stated that
              their model contained both fixed and random effects correctly
              analyzed it as a mixed model. There were two cases, however,
              where authors attempted to define fixed effects as random in
              order to justify broader generalizations about the effects. Most
              commonly (63\% of articles using two-way or greater ANOVA),
              authors neglected to mention whether they were dealing with a
              completely fixed, random, or mixed model. In such instances, it
              was not clear if the author was aware of the distinction between
              fixed and random effects, and it was often difficult to ascertain
              from the article whether their analysis was consistent with their
              experimental methods. These findings suggest several statistical
              guidelines that should be followed. In particular, the inclusion
              of explicit consideration of effects as fixed or random and clear
              descriptions of F tests of interest would provide the reader with
              confidence that the author has performed the analysis correctly.
              In addition, such an explicit statement would clarify the limits
              of the inferences about significant effects.",

              gravitational pressure gradients, the intensity of which varies
              according to organismic features, behavior, and habitat occupied.
              A previous nonphylogenetic analysis of heart position in
              snakes-which often assume vertical postures-found the heart
              located 15\%-25\% of total body length from the head in
              terrestrial and arboreal species but 25\%-45\% in aquatic
              species. It was hypothesized that a more anterior heart in
              arboreal species served to reduce the hydrostatic blood pressure
              when these animals adopt vertical postures during climbing,
              whereas an anterior heart position would not be needed in aquatic
              habitats, where the effects of gravity are less pronounced. We
              analyzed a new data set of 155 species from five major families
              of Alethinophidia (one of the two major branches of snakes, the
              other being blind snakes, Scolecophidia) using both conventional
              and phylogenetically based statistical methods. General linear
              models regressing log(10) snout-heart position on log(10)
              snout-vent length (SVL), as well as dummy variables coding for
              habitat and/or clade, were compared using likelihood ratio tests
              and the Akaike Information Criterion. Heart distance to the tip
              of the snout scaled isometrically with SVL. In all instances,
              phylogenetic models that incorporated transformation of the
              branch lengths under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution (to
              mimic stabilizing selection) better fit the data as compared with
              their nonphylogenetic counterparts. The best-fit model predicting
              snake heart position included aspects of both habitat and clade
              and indicated that arboreal snakes in our study tend to have
              hearts placed more posteriorly, opposite the trend identified in
              previous studies. Phylogenetic signal in relative heart position
              was apparent both within and among clades. Our results suggest
              that overcoming gravitational pressure gradients in snakes most
              likely involves the combined action of several cardiovascular and
              behavioral adaptations in addition to alterations in relative
              heart location.",

  title    = "Pseudoreplication and the design of ecological field experiments",
  author   = "Hurlbert, Stuart",
  abstract = "Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics
              to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where
              either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or
              replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA
              terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an
              error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered.
              Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and
              the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of
              them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential
              statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high
              in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical
              features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic
              intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an
              experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and
              preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to
              be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small
              experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only
              by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension
              of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided
              by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and
              layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions
              are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals

              contribute independently and directly to the dependent variable.
              In the second, each factor contributes indirectly to the
              dependent score. Data created with the first model can be
              analyzed flawlessly. The second often show relatively large main
              effects and relatively small interaction effects, and as a
              consequence the interaction effect may be rejected. Even when the

              Gelman is introduced with ecological examples. These examples
              demonstrate typical situations encountered in ecological studies.
              Compared to conventional methods, the multilevel approach is more
              flexible in model formulation, easier to set up, and easier to
              present. Because the emphasis is on estimation, multilevel models
              are more informative than the results from a significance test.
              The improved capacity is largely due to the changed computation
              methods. In our examples, we show that (1) the multilevel model
              is able to discern a treatment effect that is smaller than the
              conventional approach can detect, (2) the graphical presentation
              associated with the multilevel method is more informative, and

  abstract = "Felsenstein (1985) developed a method for analyzing comparative
              data that calculates a set of mutually independent comparisons
              among the species. The method was designed to be used with
              phylogenies for which the true dichotomous branching pattern is
              known. However, available phylogenies often contain many
              incompletely resolved nodes, or nodes from which three or more
              branches emanate. This paper reports a generalization of
              Felsenstein's method that permits the analysis of incompletely
              resolved phylogenies. The method is general to any sort of
              phylogeny and, like Felsenstein's model can accommodate more than
              one model of evolutionary change. The method is implemented in a
              computer program which can make use of information on branch
              lengths, or, if branch length information is not available, an
              algorithm is used to calculate a set of branch lengths. The wider
              implications of the method are that it makes explicit the
              assumptions about unknown branching patterns and branch lengths
              that all comparative methods that are applied to incompletely

              related species to retain some phenotypic similarities due to
              their shared evolutionary histories. The amount of expected
              similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic
              structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of
              evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation. In
              this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be
              translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We
              illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected
              in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this
              structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding
              phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the
              covariance structure expected from several simple
              microevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including
              various combinations of random genetic drift, directional
              selection, stabilizing selection, and environmental change, as
              well as models of punctuated or burst-like evolution. We find
              that stabilizing selection leads to patterns of exponential
              decrease of between species covariance with phylogenetic
              distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of
              decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods.
              Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many
              processes in addition to random genetic drift, such as
              directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of
              punctuated change. Our framework can be used to develop methods

  abstract = "Determining whether speciation and extinction rates depend on the
              state of a particular character has been of long-standing
              interest to evolutionary biologists. To assess the effect of a
              character on diversification rates using likelihood methods
              requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a
              group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a
              particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how
              to calculate this probability for a phylogenetic tree and a
              two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution
              (the ``BiSSE'' model, binary-state speciation and extinction).
              The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation
              rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state
              1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and
              two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to
              0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum
              likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and
              perform hypothesis tests (e.g., is the rate of speciation
              elevated for one character state over the other?). We demonstrate
              the application of the method using simulated data with known
              parameter values.",

  abstract = "Multiple hypothesis testing is concerned with controlling the
              rate of false positives when testing several hypotheses
              simultaneously. One multiple hypothesis testing error measure is
              the false discovery rate (FDR), which is loosely defined to be
              the expected proportion of false positives among all significant
              hypotheses. The FDR is especially appropriate for exploratory
              analyses in which one is interested in finding several
              significant results among many tests. In this work, we introduce
              a modified version of the FDR called the ``positive false
              discovery rate'' (pFDR). We discuss the advantages and
              disadvantages of the pFDR and investigate its statistical
              properties. When assuming the test statistics follow a mixture
              distribution, we show that the pFDR can be written as a Bayesian
              posterior probability and can be connected to classification
              theory. These properties remain asymptotically true under fairly
              general conditions, even under certain forms of dependence. Also,
              a new quantity called the ``q -value'' is introduced and
              investigated, which is a natural ``Bayesian posterior p-value,''
              or rather the pFDR analogue of the p-value.",

                 explores the bootstrap. The bootstrap gives us an empirical

                 possible values of a sample statistic such as the sample mean.
                 The appeal of the bootstrap is that we can use it to make an
                 inference about some experimental result when the statistical
                 theory is uncertain or even unknown. We can also use the
                 bootstrap to assess how well the statistical theory holds:
                 that is, whether an inference we make from a hypothesis test

                 specialized for flight, reflecting both evolutionary history
                 and the need to maintain structural integrity while generating
                 aerodynamic forces. METHODS: We analyzed the anatomical
                 structure of bat wing skeletons in the context of scaling
                 patterns relative to other mammals, material properties and
                 the mechanical function of the wing bones during flight.
                 RESULTS: Compared with nonvolant mammals, the bones of the bat
                 forelimb are elongated, even after correcting for shared
                 phylogenetic history. Bats have consistently larger-diameter
                 bones in the forelimb than do nonvolant mammals but
                 significantly narrower hindlimb bones. Mineralization in the
                 cortical bone of wings is lower than in the long bones of
                 other adult mammals, with a proximodistal gradient of
                 decreasing mineralization. The distal phalanges have only a
                 small amount of mineralized tissue underlying the articular
                 cartilage. Loads required to elicit a 10\% length deflection
                 in the wing bones of Glossophaga soricina varied approximately
                 50-fold along the wing and flexural stiffness nearly 200-fold.
                 Commensurate with low mineralization and flexural stiffness,
                 bat bones experience extraordinarily high bending strains
                 during flight. CONCLUSION: Bat limb skeletons share features
                 with other mammals and possess specialized characteristics,

              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these

                 phylogenetic scales because they typically require complete
                 sampling of both the tree and the associated phenotypic data.
                 Here, we develop and implement a new, tree-based method called
                 MECCA (Modeling Evolution of Continuous Characters using ABC)

                 (ABC)-Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach to simultaneously
                 infer rates of diversification and trait evolution from
                 incompletely sampled phylogenies and trait data. We
                 demonstrate via simulation that MECCA has considerable power

                 models, and thus can be used to test hypotheses about changes

  abstract    = "Evolutionary biologists since Darwin have been fascinated by
                 differences in the rate of trait-evolutionary change across
                 lineages. Despite this continued interest, we still lack
                 methods for identifying shifts in evolutionary rates on the
                 growing tree of life while accommodating uncertainty in the
                 evolutionary process. Here we introduce a Bayesian approach
                 for identifying complex patterns in the evolution of
                 continuous traits. The method (auteur) uses reversible-jump
                 Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to more fully characterize
                 the complexity of trait evolution, considering models that
                 range in complexity from those with a single global rate to
                 potentially ones in which each branch in the tree has its own
                 independent rate. This newly introduced approach performs well
                 in recovering simulated rate shifts and simulated rates for
                 datasets nearing the size typical for comparative phylogenetic
                 study (i.e., $\geq$64 tips). Analysis of two large empirical
                 datasets of vertebrate body size reveal overwhelming support
                 for multiple-rate models of evolution, and we observe
                 exceptionally high rates of body-size evolution in a group of
                 emydid turtles relative to their evolutionary background.
                 auteur will facilitate identification of exceptional
                 evolutionary dynamics, essential to the study of both adaptive

                 extinct organisms without the benefit of direct observation or
                 explicit fossil evidence poses a formidable challenge for
                 paleobiological studies. To date, dietary categorizations of
                 extinct taxa are largely generated by means of modern analogs;
                 however, for many species the method is subject to
                 considerable ambiguity. Here we present a refined approach for
                 assessing trophic habits in fossil taxa and apply the method
                 to coelurosaurian dinosaurs--a clade for which diet is
                 particularly controversial. Our findings detect 21
                 morphological features that exhibit statistically significant
                 correlations with extrinsic fossil evidence of coelurosaurian
                 herbivory, such as stomach contents and a gastric mill. These
                 traits represent quantitative, extrinsically founded proxies
                 for identifying herbivorous ecomorphology in fossils and are
                 robust despite uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships among
                 major coelurosaurian subclades. The distribution of these
                 features suggests that herbivory was widespread among
                 coelurosaurians, with six major subclades displaying
                 morphological evidence of the diet, and that contrary to
                 previous thought, hypercarnivory was relatively rare and
                 potentially secondarily derived. Given the potential for
                 repeated, independent evolution of herbivory in Coelurosauria,
                 we also test for repetitive patterns in the appearance of
                 herbivorous traits within sublineages using rank concordance
                 analysis. We find evidence for a common succession of
                 increasing specialization to herbivory in the subclades
                 Ornithomimosauria and Oviraptorosauria, perhaps underlain by
                 intrinsic functional and/or developmental constraints, as well
                 as evidence indicating that the early evolution of a beak in
                 coelurosaurians correlates with an herbivorous diet.",

                 ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships
                 probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research
                 finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted
                 in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when

                 misguided estimate of variability among observations. Instead,

                 Although statisticians continue to stress the limitations of
                 hypothesis tests, there are two realities we must acknowledge:
                 hypothesis tests are ingrained within science, and the simple
                 test of a null hypothesis can be useful. As a result, it

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Uncertainty in comparative analyses can come from
                 at least two sources: a) phylogenetic uncertainty in the tree
                 topology or branch lengths, and b) uncertainty due to
                 intraspecific variation in trait values, either due to
                 measurement error or natural individual variation. Most
                 phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for such
                 uncertainties. Not accounting for these sources of uncertainty
                 leads to false perceptions of precision (confidence intervals
                 will be too narrow) and inflated significance in hypothesis
                 testing (e.g. p-values will be too small). Although there is
                 some application-specific software for fitting Bayesian models
                 accounting for phylogenetic error, more general and flexible
                 software is desirable. METHODS: We developed models to
                 directly incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty into a range of
                 analyses that biologists commonly perform, using a Bayesian
                 framework and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses. RESULTS: We
                 demonstrate applications in linear regression, quantification
                 of phylogenetic signal, and measurement error models.
                 Phylogenetic uncertainty was incorporated by applying a prior
                 distribution for the phylogeny, where this distribution
                 consisted of the posterior tree sets from Bayesian
                 phylogenetic tree estimation programs. The models were
                 analysed using simulated data sets, and applied to a real data
                 set on plant traits, from rainforest plant species in Northern
                 Australia. Analyses were performed using the free and open
                 source software OpenBUGS and JAGS. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating
                 phylogenetic uncertainty through an empirical prior
                 distribution of trees leads to more precise estimation of
                 regression model parameters than using a single consensus tree
                 and enables a more realistic estimation of confidence
                 intervals. In addition, models incorporating measurement
                 errors and/or individual variation, in one or both variables,
                 are easily formulated in the Bayesian framework. We show that
                 BUGS is a useful, flexible general purpose tool for
                 phylogenetic comparative analyses, particularly for modelling
                 in the face of phylogenetic uncertainty and accounting for
                 measurement error or individual variation in explanatory
                 variables. Code for all models is provided in the BUGS model
                 description language.",

              theory that formally incorporates statistical investigation into
              a decision-theoretic framework to account for uncertainties in a
              decision problem. SDT provides a unifying analysis of three types
              of information: statistical results from a data set, knowledge of
              the consequences of potential choices (i.e., loss), and prior
              beliefs about a system. SDT links the theoretical development of
              a large body of statistical methods including point estimation,
              hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation. The
              theory and application of SDT have mainly been developed and
              published in the fields of mathematics, statistics, operations
              research, and other decision sciences, but have had limited
              exposure in ecology. Thus, we provide an introduction to SDT for
              ecologists and describe its utility for linking the
              conventionally separate tasks of statistical investigation and
              decision making in a single framework. We describe the basic
              framework of both Bayesian and frequentist SDT, its traditional
              use in statistics, and discuss its application to decision
              problems that occur in ecology. We demonstrate SDT with two types
              of decisions: Bayesian point estimation, and an applied
              management problem of selecting a prescribed fire rotation for
              managing a grassland bird species. Central to SDT, and decision
              theory in general, are loss functions. Thus, we also provide
              basic guidance and references for constructing loss functions for
              an SDT problem.",

  author   = "Storey, John D",
  abstract = "Summary. The Neyman--Pearson lemma provides a simple procedure
              for optimally testing a single hypothesis when the null and
              alternative distributions are known. This result has played a
              major role in the development of significance testing strategies
              that are used in practice. Most of the work extending
              single-testing strategies to multiple tests has focused on
              formulating and estimating new types of significance measures,
              such as the false discovery rate. These methods tend to be based
              on p-values that are calculated from each test individually,
              ignoring information from the other tests. I show here that one
              can improve the overall performance of multiple significance
              tests by borrowing information across all the tests when
              assessing the relative significance of each one, rather than
              calculating p-values for each test individually. The ‘optimal
              discovery procedure’ is introduced, which shows how to maximize
              the number of expected true positive results for each fixed
              number of expected false positive results. The optimality that is
              achieved by this procedure is shown to be closely related to
              optimality in terms of the false discovery rate. The optimal
              discovery procedure motivates a new approach to testing multiple
              hypotheses, especially when the tests are related. As a simple
              example, a new simultaneous procedure for testing several normal
              means is defined; this is surprisingly demonstrated to outperform
              the optimal single-test procedure, showing that a method which is
              optimal for single tests may no longer be optimal for multiple
              tests. Connections to other concepts in statistics are discussed,
              including Stein's paradox, shrinkage estimation and the Bayesian
              approach to hypothesis testing.",

              testing quantity that describes the expected proportion of false
              positive results among all rejected null hypotheses. Benjamini
              and Hochberg introduced this quantity and proved that a
              particular step-up p-value method controls the FDR. Storey
              introduced a point estimate of the FDR for fixed significance
              regions. The former approach conservatively controls the FDR at a
              fixed predetermined level, and the latter provides a
              conservatively biased estimate of the FDR for a fixed
              predetermined significance region. In this work, we show in both
              finite sample and asymptotic settings that the goals of the two
              approaches are essentially equivalent. In particular, the FDR
              point estimates can be used to define valid FDR controlling
              procedures. In the asymptotic setting, we also show that the
              point estimates can be used to estimate the FDR conservatively
              over all significance regions simultaneously, which is equivalent
              to controlling the FDR at all levels simultaneously. The main
              tool that we use is to translate existing FDR methods into
              procedures involving empirical processes. This simplifies finite
              sample proofs, provides a framework for asymptotic results and

              deliberate focus on the a priori science in developing a set of
              multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow
              these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and
              scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of
              each model (gi), given the data and the models in the set (i.e.
              L(gi | data)). In addition, a variance component due to

              building multilevel models in the settings where multiple

              (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical

              adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider

                 standardized-data. As researchers, we compute a ratio-a
                 numerator divided by a denominator-to compute a proportion for
                 some biological response or to derive some standardized
                 variable. In each situation, we want to control for
                 differences in the denominator when the thing we really care
                 about is the numerator. But there is peril lurking in a ratio:
                 only if the relationship between numerator and denominator is
                 a straight line through the origin will the ratio be
                 meaningful. If not, the ratio will misrepresent the true
                 relationship between numerator and denominator. In contrast,
                 regression techniques-these include analysis of covariance-are
                 versatile: they can accommodate an analysis of the
                 relationship between numerator and denominator when a ratio is
                 useless.",

  abstract = "Summary. Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against
              much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing.
              Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a
              single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for
              multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false
              discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential
              p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a
              sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its
              corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite
              approach---we fix the rejection region and then estimate its
              corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased
              applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to
              both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide
              evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the
              quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation
              of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which
              eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is
              traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented
              that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over
              eight times in power compared with the Benjamini--Hochberg FDR

                 of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has
                 become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that
                 thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested
                 against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are
                 expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to
                 measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies
                 based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This
                 approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true
                 and false positives that is automatically calibrated and
                 easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical
                 significance called the q value is associated with each tested
                 feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value,
                 except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false
                 discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our
                 approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while
                 offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in

              one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in
              statistical significance are often not themselves statistically
              significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace
              observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary-for
              example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from
              a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into
              statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even
              large changes in significance levels can correspond to small,
              nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we
              describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited
              problems-that statistical significance is not the same as
              practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and
              nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed
              differences in favor of the usually less interesting null
              hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold
              for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all
              of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance.
              Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error
              of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and
              two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error
              leads us to suggest that Students and practitioners be made more

              to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It
              calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected

              equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is

  abstract  = "A simple answer is found for the following question which has
               plagued the practice of the analysis of variance: Under the
               usual assumptions, if the conventional F-test of the hypothesis
               H: $\mu$1 = $\mu$2 = ... = $\mu$k at the $\alpha$ level of
               significance rejects H, what further inferences are valid about
               the contrasts among the $\mu$i (beyond the inference that the
               values of the contrasts are not all zero)? Suppose the F-test
               has k - 1 and $\nu$ degrees of freedom. For any c1, ..., ck with
               $\sum$k 1 ci = 0 write $\vartheta$ for the contrast $\sum$k 1
               ci$\mu$i, and write $\hat\theta$ and $\hat\sigma^2_\hat\theta$
               for the usual estimates of $\vartheta$ and the variance of
               $\hat\theta$. Then for the totality of contrasts, no matter what
               the true values of the $\vartheta$'s, the probability is 1 -
               $\alpha$ that they all satisfy $\hat\theta -
               S\hat\sigma_\hat\theta \leqslant \theta \leqslant \hat\theta +
               S\hat\sigma_\hat\theta,$ where S2 is (k - 1) times the upper
               $\alpha$ point of the F-distribution with k - 1 and $\nu$
               degrees of freedom. Suppose we say that the estimated contrast
               $\hat\theta$ is `significantly different from zero' if
               $|\hat\theta| > S\hat\sigma_\hat\theta$. Then the F-test rejects
               H if and only if some $\hat\theta$ are significantly different
               from zero, and if it does, we can say just which $\hat\theta$.
               More generally, the above inequality can be employed for all the
               contrasts with the obvious frequency interpretation about the
               proportion of experiments in which all statements are correct.
               Relations are considered to an earlier method of Tukey using the
               Studentized range tables and valid in the special case where the
               $\hat\mu_i$ all have the same variance and all pairs $\hat\mu_i,
               \hat\mu_j (i \neq j)$ have the same covariance. Some results are
               obtained for the operating characteristic of the new method. The

               comparing statistical measures (means, proportions, etc.) of the
               properties or effects of the pairs of the levels of a factor
               (varieties, treatments, locations, etc.). If there are only two
               levels of the factor, a comparison of the values of the measure
               of interest for the two levels is quite simple and
               straightforward and statistical tests of the significance of the
               difference between two means, two proportions, two variances,
               etc., are well known. Then the question arises as to the way to
               take an account of the number of levels and the rank in the
               group of the two levels singled out for attention with regard to
               the measure of interest. The relevance of this ranking in
               testing the significance of the difference between two levels or
               between one level and the average for all of the levels has long
               been recognized. The ten years immediately following the close
               of World War II saw a great increase in interest in multiple
               comparisons, especially in the United States. The chapter

  abstract  = "Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics, Multiple
               Comparisons Using R describes the common underlying theory of
               multiple comparison procedures through numerous examples. It
               also presents a detailed description of available software
               implementations in R. The R packages and source code for the
               analyses are available at http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving
               examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general
               concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including
               the Bonferroni method and Simes’ test. It then shows how to
               perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear
               models and general parametric models. It also introduces the
               multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient interface to
               perform multiple comparisons in a general context. Following
               this theoretical framework, the book explores applications
               involving the Dunnett test, Tukey’s all pairwise comparisons,
               and general multiple contrast tests for standard regression
               models, mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models.
               The last chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures,
               such as resampling-based procedures, methods for group
               sequential or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple
               comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling
               multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making and
               safeguards against false claims. A self-contained introduction
               to multiple comparison procedures, this book offers strategies
               for constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework
               for multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It
               is suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge
               of multiple comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz

                 testing procedure (asymptotically) controlling the family-wise
                 error rate (FWER) can be augmented into procedures that
                 (asymptotically) control tail probabilities for the number of
                 false positives and the proportion of false positives among
                 the rejected hypotheses. Specifically, given any procedure
                 that (asymptotically) controls the FWER at level alpha, we
                 propose simple augmentation procedures that provide
                 (asymptotic) level-alpha control of: (i) the generalized
                 family-wise error rate, i.e., the tail probability, gFWER(k),
                 that the number of Type I errors exceeds a user-supplied
                 integer k, and (ii) the tail probability, TPPFP(q), that the
                 proportion of Type I errors among the rejected hypotheses
                 exceeds a user-supplied value 0<q<1. Existing approaches for
                 control of the proportion of false positives typically rely on
                 the assumption that the test statistics are independent, while
                 our proposed augmentation procedures control the gFWER and
                 TPPFP for general data generating distributions, with
                 arbitrary dependence structures among variables. Applying the
                 augmentation methods to step-down multiple testing procedures
                 that control the FWER asymptotically exactly at level alpha
                 (van der Laan et al., 2004), yields procedures that also
                 provide exact asymptotic control of the gFWER and TPPFP at
                 level alpha. The adjusted p-values for the gFWER and
                 TPPFP-controlling augmentation procedures are shown to be
                 simple functions of the adjusted p-values for the original
                 FWER-controlling procedure. Finally, two simple conservative
                 procedures are proposed for controlling the false discovery

                   is well suited to discover relations that may exist between
                   categories of different variables. The graphical
                   representation of MCA results in so-called biplots makes it
                   easy to interpret the most important associations. However,
                   a major drawback of MCA is that it does not have an
                   underlying probability model for an individual selecting a
                   category on a variable. In this paper, we propose such
                   probability model called multinomial multiple correspondence
                   analysis (MMCA) that combines the underlying low-rank
                   representation of MCA with maximum likelihood. An efficient
                   majorization algorithm that uses an elegant bound for the
                   second derivative is derived to estimate the parameters. The
                   proposed model can easily lead to overfitting causing some
                   of the parameters to wander of to infinity. We add the
                   nuclear norm penalty to counter this issue and discuss ways
                   of selecting regularization parameters. The proposed
                   approach is well suited to study and vizualise the

  abstract = "Multiple linear regression analyses (also often referred to as
              generalized linear models -- GLMs, or generalized linear mixed
              models -- GLMMs) are widely used in the analysis of data in
              molecular ecology, often to assess the relative effects of
              genetic characteristics on individual fitness or traits, or how
              environmental characteristics influence patterns of genetic
              differentiation. However, the coefficients resulting from
              multiple regression analyses are sometimes misinterpreted, which
              can lead to incorrect interpretations and conclusions within
              individual studies, and can propagate to wider-spread errors in
              the general understanding of a topic. The primary issue revolves
              around the interpretation of coefficients for independent
              variables when interaction terms are also included in the
              analyses. In this scenario, the coefficients associated with each
              independent variable are often interpreted as the independent
              effect of each predictor variable on the predicted variable.
              However, this interpretation is incorrect. The correct
              interpretation is that these coefficients represent the effect of
              each predictor variable on the predicted variable when all other
              predictor variables are zero. This difference may sound subtle,
              but the ramifications cannot be overstated. Here, my goals are to

              variation in social structure leads to differences in the
              relative importance of intraspecific aggression. Here, we present
              a large comparative dataset on sexual dimorphism in skeletal
              shape in Carnivora to test the hypotheses that carnivorans
              exhibit sexual dimorphism in skeletal anatomy that is reflective
              of greater specialization for physical aggression in males
              relative to females and that this dimorphism is associated with
              the intensity of sexual selection. We tested these hypotheses
              using a set of functional indices predicted to improve aggressive
              performance. Our results indicate that skeletal shape dimorphism
              is widespread within our sample. Functional traits thought to
              enhance aggressive performance are more pronounced in males.
              Phylogenetic model selection suggests that the evolution of this
              dimorphism is driven by sexual selection, with the best-fitting
              model indicating greater dimorphism in polygynous versus
              nonpolygynous species. Skeletal shape dimorphism is correlated
              with body size dimorphism, a common indicator of the intensity of
              male--male competition, but not with mean body size. These

                 kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are
                 confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true
                 parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples,

                 and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%)

  abstract = "We introduce a novel Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale
              hypothesis testing, including estimating False Discovery Rates
              (FDRs), and estimating effect sizes. Compared with existing
              approaches to FDR analysis, the method has two key differences.
              First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual
              (unobserved) effects being tested is unimodal, with a mode at 0.
              This ``unimodal assumption'' (UA), although natural in many
              contexts, is very different from assumptions usually made in FDR
              analyses, and yields more accurate inferences than existing
              methods provided that it holds. The UA also facilitates efficient
              and robust computation because estimating the unimodal
              distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization
              problem. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for
              each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard
              error), rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z
              score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps
              account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It
              also facilitates the estimation of actual effect sizes, and our
              approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each
              effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a
              bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we
              introduce the term ``local false sign rate'' to refer to the
              probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue
              that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR
              because it is both more generally applicable, and can be more
              robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package

              running in minutes for hundreds of species, and can handle
              multiple traits. We also propose a phylogenetic Bayesian
              information criterion (pBIC) that accounts for the phylogenetic

              examined whether the best-fit hypothesis of modularity is the
              same as the shape subset with the greatest difference in
              evolutionary rate. Here, we develop a new phylogenetic
              comparative method for comparing evolutionary rates among
              high-dimensional traits, and apply this method to analyze body
              shape evolution in bioluminescent lanternfishes. We frame the
              study of evolutionary rates and modularity through analysis of
              three hypotheses derived from the literature on fish development,
              biomechanics, and bioluminescent communication. We show that a
              development-informed partitioning of shape exhibits the greatest
              evolutionary rate differences among modules, but that a
              hydrodynamically informed partitioning is the best-fit modularity

              photophores evolve at a similar rate as, and are strongly
              integrated with, body shape in lanternfishes. These results
              suggest that overlapping life-history constraints on development
              and movement define axes of body shape evolution in
              lanternfishes, and that the positions of their lateral photophore
              complexes are likely a passive outcome of the interaction of
              these ecological pressures.",

                 Addressing these problems is frustrated by the lack of a
                 formal framework that jointly represents hypothesis formation,
                 replication, publication bias, and variation in research
                 quality. We develop a mathematical model of scientific
                 discovery that combines all of these elements. This model
                 provides both a dynamic model of research as well as a formal
                 framework for reasoning about the normative structure of
                 science. We show that replication may serve as a ratchet that
                 gradually separates true hypotheses from false, but the same
                 factors that make initial findings unreliable also make
                 replications unreliable. The most important factors in
                 improving the reliability of research are the rate of false
                 positives and the base rate of true hypotheses, and we offer
                 suggestions for addressing each. Our results also bring
                 clarity to verbal debates about the communication of research.
                 Surprisingly, publication bias is not always an obstacle, but
                 instead may have positive impacts-suppression of negative
                 novel findings is often beneficial. We also find that
                 communication of negative replications may aid true discovery
                 even when attempts to replicate have diminished power. The
                 model speaks constructively to ongoing debates about the

              promising from the standpoint of understanding a wide variety of
              evolutionary patterns and processes. With trees comprised of
              larger, older, and globally distributed clades, it is likely that
              the lability of a binary character will differ significantly

               dimorphic exaggerated display structures. Herein, we explore
               whether such costly ornamental integumentary structures evolve
               independently or if they are correlated with phenotypic change
               in the associated skeletal system. In birds, elongate tail
               feathers have frequently evolved in males and are beneficial as
               intraspecific display structures but impart a
               locomotor/energetic cost. Using the sexually dimorphic tail
               feathers of several passeriform species as a model system, we
               test the hypothesis that taxa with sexually dimorphic tail
               feathers also exhibit sexual dimorphism in the caudal skeleton
               that supports the muscles and integument of the tail apparatus.
               Caudal skeletal morphology is quantified using both geometric
               morphometrics and linear morphometrics across four sexually
               dimorphic passeriform species and four closely related
               monomorphic species. Sexual dimorphism is assessed using
               permutational MANOVA. Sexual dimorphism in caudal skeletal
               morphology is found only in those taxa that exhibit active
               functional differences in tail use between males and females.
               Thus, dimorphism in tail feather length is not necessarily
               correlated with the evolution of caudal skeletal dimorphism.
               Sexual selection is sufficient to generate phenotypic divergence
               in integumentary display structures between the sexes, but these
               change are not reflected in the underlying caudal skeleton. This
               suggests that caudal feathers and bones evolve
               semi-independently from one another and evolve at different
               rates in response to different types of selective pressures.",

  abstract    = "The logistic transformation, originally suggested by Johnson
                 (1949), is applied to analyze responses that are restricted to
                 a finite interval (e.g. (0,1)), so-called bounded outcome
                 scores. Bounded outcome scores often have a non-standard
                 distribution, e.g. J- or U-shaped, precluding classical
                 parametric statistical approaches for analysis. Applying the
                 logistic transformation on a normally distributed random
                 variable, gives rise to a logit-normal (LN) distribution. This
                 distribution can take a variety of shapes on (0,1). Further,
                 the model can be extended to correct for (baseline)
                 covariates. Therefore, the method could be useful for
                 comparative clinical trials. Bounded outcomes can be found in
                 many research areas, e.g. drug compliance research,
                 quality-of-life studies, and pain (and pain relief) studies
                 using visual analog scores, but all these scores can attain
                 the boundary values 0 or 1. A natural extension of the above
                 approach is therefore to assume a latent score on 0,1) having
                 a LN distribution. Two cases are considered: (a) the bounded
                 outcome score is a proportion where the true probabilities
                 have a LN distribution on (0,1) and (b) the bounded outcome
                 score on [0,1] is a coarsened version of a latent score with a
                 LN distribution on (0,1). We also allow the variance (on the
                 transformed scale) to depend on treatment. The usefulness of
                 our approach for comparative clinical trials will be assessed
                 in this paper. It turns out to be important to distinguish the
                 case of equal and unequal variances. For a bounded outcome
                 score of the second type and with equal variances, our
                 approach comes close to ordinal probit (OP) regression.
                 However, ignoring the inequality of variances can lead to
                 highly biased parameter estimates. A simulation study compares
                 the performance of our approach with the two-sample Wilcoxon
                 test and with OP regression. Finally, the different methods

                 present two methods to test for such effects: these are a

                 a problem of great interest to the genetic mapping community.
                 Methods for locating these quantitative trait loci (QTL)
                 relative to maps of genetic markers are now widely used. This
                 paper addresses an issue common to all QTL mapping methods,
                 that of determining an appropriate threshold value for
                 declaring significant QTL effects. An empirical method is
                 described, based on the concept of a permutation test, for
                 estimating threshold values that are tailored to the
                 experimental data at hand. The method is demonstrated using
                 two real data sets derived from F(2) and recombinant inbred
                 plant populations. An example using simulated data from a
                 backcross design illustrates the effect of marker density on
                 threshold values.",

              Density in New England Bogs and Forests",
  author   = "Gotelli, Nicholas J and Ellison, Aaron M",
  abstract = "We examined species density gradients of ants of New England in
              22 ombrotrophic bogs and their surrounding forests. We tested the
              hypothesis that species density was correlated with large-scale
              geographic variables (latitude, longitude, elevation) and
              small-scale site variables (habitat area, vegetation composition,
              light availability). Species density was consistently higher in
              forests than in bogs. Ant species density measured in three other
              New World studies yielded similar results, with steeper diversity
              slopes in closed canopy vs. open habitats. In New England bogs
              and forests, latitude was the single most important predictor of
              species density, even though the latitudinal span of the entire
              study region was less than three degrees. Diversity patterns
              documented in our study of mid-latitude ant communities are
              similar to those seen in studies spanning tropical and temperate
              habitats. Species density of forest ants was associated strongly
              with latitude, elevation, light availability, and vegetation
              composition. Species density of bog ants was less predictable and
              was correlated only with latitude and vegetation. Overall, our
              results suggest that species--energy relationships are important
              at regional spatial scales. Explanations for the latitudinal
              gradient in ant species density may not depend on unique
              differences between tropical and temperate communities, but could
              operate at all latitudes.",

  abstract    = "Poor research design and data analysis encourage
                 false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite
                 perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result
                 from something more than just misunderstanding. The
                 persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives
                 that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad
                 science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing-no
                 deliberate cheating nor loafing-by scientists, only that
                 publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some
                 normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been
                 selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order
                 to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away
                 from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding
                 understanding. We support this argument with empirical
                 evidence and computational modelling. We first present a
                 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural
                 sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated
                 demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To
                 demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives,
                 we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in
                 which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously
                 published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research
                 methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more
                 'progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and
                 their students are more likely to start labs of their own.
                 Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and
                 increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show
                 that replication slows but does not stop the process of
                 methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of
                 research requires change at the institutional level.",
