## Goals for multilevel models

*Very Important*:

- Understand the nature of the problems we are trying to solve
- Understand the value in solving them

*Moderately Important*:

- Understand some of the technical aspects of multilevel model fitting and interpretation

*Minimally Important*:

- Understand the math involved

## Assumptions of linear regression

1. Normality (check pooled residuals)
1. Homogeneity (check pooled residuals, transformation?)
1. Fixed explanatory variables (plan sampling)
1. Independence (observations often correlated)
1. Correct model

## Non-independence: The main challenge

Our tests (so far) assume independence of samples.

Lots of data have structure at additional levels beyond the main variable(s) of interest

- Error in these levels is correlated (making the data non-independent)

We need a method to model that correlation structure.

## Correlated data

*Explicitly* by design:

- Grouping (leaves within plants within treatments within fields)
- Repeated measurements of the same individual (time or space)

*Implicitly* as a side effect:

- Non-equal sample sizes, missing data
- Non-equal within-group variance
- Phylogenetic structure 
- Population structure and genetic relatedness 

## Some terminology

*Multilevel / hierarchical / mixed / repeated measures models*

- All refer to the same class of models, which contain both fixed and random variables.
- Some will further subdivide and draw fine distinctions between models.

## Some terminology

*Fixed effects*:

- Explanatory variables of primary interest, which would be used again if the experiment were repeated
- Sex, treatment groups, etc.

## Some terminology

*Random effects*

- Variables that are a "random" selection from a larger set of variables that allow for heterogeneity, correlation, phylogenetic or genetic structure, real random variation ($\epsilon$).
- Subject, block, etc.
- "Random" does not necessarily mean "not of interest."

Also see: http://andrewgelman.com/2005/01/25/why_i_dont_use/

## Fundamental idea of multilevel models

Units are *grouped* at different levels.

- Grouping takes different forms

## General multilevel model formula

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \mbox{Random}$$

Where $\mbox{Random}$ can be:

- Random noise ($\epsilon$)
- Heterogeneity of variance
- Nesting structure
- Temporal correlation (autocorrelation)
- Spatial correlation
- Phylogenetic correlation
- Genetic correlation

## Hierarchical structure

- Maneuver (hover vs. clockwise, hover vs. counterclockwise)
    - Bird (4)
        - Trial (5)
            - Wingbeat (mean of 16 $\rightarrow$ 1)

1. Maneuver is the variable of interest ("fixed")
1. Birds are a representative sample of all birds ("random")
1. Trials are repeated measures of each bird ("random")
1. Wingbeats are the observation level

## What we did

1. Calculate means of 16 wingbeats for each bird for each trial
    - Loss of information, but...
1. Five trials per bird
1. Multilevel ANOVA
    - Bird and trial nested within bird as random effects
    - Maneuver as the fixed effect

Each bird gets its own mean value for a maneuver (across 5 trials). Maneuver is analyzed as the mean difference between each maneuver.

## Challenges to multilevel models

**Conceptual complexity**

- You must know your model
- Difficult to visualize
- Do my results make sense?

**Computational complexity**

- Many methods fit by likelihood
- MCMC can be slow, difficult to tune
- Bayesian requires defining priors

## Fitting multilevel models

Among the options for R packages:

- `nlme`: Oldest, restricted to a subset of models (linear and non-linear Gaussian), *for us the place to start*
- `lme4`: Newer (but same authors as `nlme`), can handle more complex models with crossed random effects, pedigrees, non-Gaussian response, etc., more flexible distributions of response variables, but harder to test hypotheses
- `MCMCglmm`, `rstan`, `rjags`: Fit Bayesian multilevel models via a variety of MCMC samplers

## *Loligo forbesii*

<center>
<img src="images/loligo.jpg" width="80%" />
</center>

Seasonal patterns in testis mass in the squid *Loligo*. Testis mass predicted by dorsal mantle length, month, and DML X month.

## `Squid` data

```{r}
S <- read_excel("../data/Squid.xlsx")
S <- S %>% mutate(Month = factor(Month))
str(S)

# Check for missing data
sum(!complete.cases(S))
```

## Visualizing

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(S, aes(DML, Testis_Mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Dorsal Mantle Length (mm)", y = "Testis Mass (g)")
```

## Visualizing

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(S, aes(DML, Testis_Mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Month", nrow = 3) +
  labs(x = "Dorsal Mantle Length (mm)", y = "Testis Mass (g)")
```

## Multiple regression

Testis mass modeled by `DML`, `Month`, and the `DML` X `Month` interaction:

```{r}
fm1 <- lm(Testis_Mass ~ DML + Month + DML:Month, data = S)
```

Extract the residuals and fitted values:

```{r}
S$Res1 <- residuals(fm1)
S$Fitted <- fitted.values(fm1)
```

## Residuals vs. Fitted Values

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(S, aes(Fitted, Res1)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals")
```

## Residuals vs. Month

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(S, aes(Month, Res1)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Residuals")
```

## Dealing with heterogeneity within groups

**What we need**:
 
 1. Allow for change in variance with values of `DML` (here, more spread with larger values)
 1. Allow for difference variances per month

**Solution**:

- Generalized least squares $\approx$ "Weighted regression"
- `nlme::gls()`
- Also one solution for phylogenetic least squares (coming soon)

## Fitting a weighted regression

```{r}
library(nlme)
variance_struct <- varPower(form = ~ DML | Month)
```

- This structure allows the *residual* variance to change with `DML` on a per-`Month` basis.
- Here a power relationship
    - Other variance structures available

```{r gls_fit}
fm2 <- gls(Testis_Mass ~ DML * Month, data = S,
           weights = variance_struct)
```

## Diagnostics

```{r}
plot(fm2)
```

## Summary {.smaller}

```{r}
library(car)
Anova(fm2, type = "III")
```

## Visualization of the model

```{r}
S$Res2 <- residuals(fm2, type = "normalized")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(S, aes(DML, Res2)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Month") +
  labs(x = "Dorsal Mantle Length",
       y = "Normalized Residual Testis Mass")
```

## Visualization of the model

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(S, aes(Month, Res2)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(c(-10, 10)) +
  labs(x = "Month",
       y = "Normalized Residual Testis Mass")
```

## Coefficients {.smaller}

```{r echo=FALSE}
as.data.frame(coef(fm2))
```

## Nested data

Data with hierarchical structure:

- *i* samples within *n* blocks

We could just take a means of each block and use those data for ANOVA.

- Lose all the information about variability within blocks
- Might increase apparent variance

## Intertidal species richness

Collected by National Institute for Coastal and Marine Management (RIKZ)

<center>
<img src="images/intertidal.jpg" width="100%" />
</center>

## Intertidal data

```{r}
RIKZ <- read_excel("../data/RIKZ.xlsx")
glimpse(RIKZ)
```

- `Richness`: Number of species
- `NAP`: Height above mean tidal level
- `Exposure`: Index composed of wave action, length of the surf zone, slope, grain size, and the depth of the anaerobic layer

## Preparing data

Convert `Beach` to factor.

```{r}
RIKZ <- RIKZ %>% mutate(Beach = factor(Beach))
```

## Sampling structure

<center>
<img src="images/RIKZ.jpg" width="100%" />
</center>

Sites are the level of the observation.

## Sampling structure

```{r}
RIKZ %>% group_by(Beach) %>% tally()
```

5 observations at each of 9 beaches

## Visualizing `NAP`

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(RIKZ, aes(NAP, Richness)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Beach", nrow = 3)
```

## Visualizing `Exposure`

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(RIKZ, aes(Exposure, Richness)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Beach", nrow = 3)
```

Each `Beach` only has 1 value of `Exposure`.

## Naive multiple regression model

```{r}
fm1 <- lm(Richness ~ NAP + Beach, data = RIKZ)
Anova(fm1, type = "III")
```

## Naive multiple regression model

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(fm1, which = 1)
```

Maybe we are not interested in knowing the exact nature of the beach effect.

## Multilevel model

Allow a different mean richness per beach:

```{r}
fm2 <- lme(Richness ~ NAP, random = ~ 1 | Beach, data = RIKZ)
```

## Diagnostics

```{r}
plot(fm2)
```

## Summary {.smaller}

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(fm2)
```

## Visualizing the model

Generate predicted values for overall population level estimates and within beach estimates.

```{r}
# Overall
RIKZ$Pred0 <- fitted(fm2, level = 0)

# Within beach
RIKZ$Pred1 <- fitted(fm2, level = 1)
```
 
## Visualizing the model

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(RIKZ, aes(NAP, Richness)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Beach)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Pred0), lwd = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Pred1, color = Beach)) +
  labs(x = "NAP", y = "Richness")
```

## Does the relationship differ per beach?

Allow each `Beach` to have its own `NAP` to `Richness` linear relationship:

```{r}
fm3 <- lme(Richness ~ NAP, random = ~ NAP | Beach, data = RIKZ)
```

Now the `NAP` to `Richness` relationship can vary for each `Beach`.

Model formula for random effects:

$$\sim \mbox{Slope}~|~\mbox{Intercept}$$

## Summary {.smaller}

```{r}
summary(fm3)
```

## Visualizing the model

Generate predicted values for overall population level estimates and within beach estimates.

```{r}
# Overall
RIKZ$Pred0 <- fitted(fm3, level = 0)

# Within beach
RIKZ$Pred1 <- fitted(fm3, level = 1)
```

## Visualizing the model

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(RIKZ, aes(NAP, Richness)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Beach)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Pred0), lwd = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Pred1, color = Beach)) +
  labs(x = "NAP", y = "Richness")
```

## Coefficients

```{r echo=FALSE}
coef(fm3)
```

## Longitudinal studies

Sequential measurements of the same individual / plot / organism, etc. will result in within-subject correlation.

O <- O %>% mutate(Subject = factor(Subject),
                  Sex = factor(Sex))
glimpse(O)
```

## Orthodonics data

## Visualizing

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(O, aes(Age, Distance)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap("Subject") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9))
```

## Visualizing

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(O, aes(Age, Distance, color = Subject)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Sex)
```

## Do boys and girls grow at different rates?

- Main effects of `Age` and `Sex` (like an ANCOVA model).
- Random effects allow the `Age` by `Distance` relationship (slope) to vary for each `Subject`, which is also allowed to have its own mean.

```{r}
fm2 <- lme(Distance ~ Sex + Age, random = ~ Age | Subject,
           method = "ML",
           data = O)
```

## Predicted values

```{r}
# Overall
O$Pred0 <- fitted(fm2, level = 0)

# Age within Subject
O$Pred1 <- fitted(fm2, level = 1)
```

## Visualizing

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(O, aes(Age, Distance)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Subject)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Pred0), lwd = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Pred1, color = Subject)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Distance") +
  facet_grid(. ~ Sex) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Reasons to use multilevel models {.smaller}

Adapted from McElreath [-@McElreath2015-no]

1. *To adjust estimates for repeat sampling*. When more than one observation arises from the same individual, location, or time, then traditional, single-level models may mislead us.
2. *To adjust estimates for imbalance in sampling*. When some individuals, locations, or times are sampled more than others, we may also be misled by single-level models.
3. *To study variation*. If research questions include variation among individuals or other groups within the data, multilevel models help, because they model variation explicitly.
4. *To avoid averaging*. Avoid pre-average to construct variables for a regression analysis. Averaging removes variation. Multilevel models allow us to preserve the uncertainty in the original, pre-averaged values, while still using the average to make predictions.

## Can poor experimental design be saved by multilevel models?

No.

## No quiz
